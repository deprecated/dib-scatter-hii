Using the model that the low Wing group is a bunch of edge-on fronts, then it makes sense that the normalized Raman component is stronger there, because we are seeing all the Raman emission but not all the Ha emission (because the overlying Ha emission comes from further away than the layer producing the Raman component.

Maybe add a calculation of the ratio to H alpha for the entire region.

I am most grateful to the referee for a most helpful report and for the kind comments about the paper.  I have tried to follow all the suggestions as detailed below.
Note that I provide a version of the manuscript with all changes marked in red (appended after the regular manuscript in the PDF file), which was prepared using the latexdiff tool.

**** 1. Page 2, Column 2:
: The author appears to be unaware of the fact that the continuum
: underlying the H-alpha region in the spectrum of the Orion nebula
: contains a contribution due to extended red emission (ERE).  Perrin &

: for several regions coinciding with those studied by the author. The
: ERE intensity is comparable to the intensity of dust-scattered
: starlight, particularly in instances when the dust scattering occurs
: predominantly at large angles as is the case in edge-on PDRs such as

: Lai et al. (2017 MNRAS 469, 4933) showed that the ERE arises in the

:

: and some of the problems encountered with the continuum fitting
: mentioned on page 14 may be a consequence of the ERE and structure
: within its spectrum.

Indeed. Although I had read the Perrin & Sivan paper at some point in the past, the ERE is not something I had considered while writing this paper.  I am very grateful to the referee for drawing my attention to the omission.  I have added a paragraph to the end of section 2.1 to address this point.

Yes, this is a good point.  I have made the suggested changes.

This is a very good idea.  I have added a new figure (Fig 7) that shows sample spectra for the range 5725 to 5925 angstrom, which includes the DIB features and some stellar absorption lines.

Agreed. Fixed.

: absorption cross-sections found in the diffuse ISM for the Ly-beta

: 296). This suggests to me that dust destruction may have occurred in
: the Orion bar PDR. The author might want to add a sentence to this
: effect in this section.

In the manuscript I did not carefully distinguish between extinction and absorption cross sections here.  It should be the absorption cross section that is important for the case of limiting the Raman-scattered intensity.  Given that, I think that the value of 5e-22 *is* marginally consistent with Weingartner & Draine.  From their Fig 14 I find an extinction cross section of roughly 1e-21 at Ly-beta for RV=5.5.  From their Fig 15, the albedo is about 0.35, yielding an absorption cross section of 6.5e-22.  I have changed the wording to try and clarify this and mention the possibility of dust destruction.

Thank you! Fixed. 


**** Additional changes
As a result of further reflection and comments from colleagues, I have made the following minor additions and changes to the manuscript:

+ Section 1: added more references to previous observations of Raman scattering in different astronomical contexts
+ Figures 2, 3 and 8: added two additional regions for spectral samples: the Big Arc, which is selected because the Raman scattered wings are relatively weak, and the Dark Bay, which is selected as an example of high foreground extinction.
+ Section 2.2: by studying the spectrum of the Dark Bay, it becomes apparent that some of the previously mysterious absorption features in the blue wing of H alpha are probably DIB features.  I discuss this here and at the end of section 2.6.3
+ Section 2.4: try to distinguish more carefully between observed structure in the plane of the sky and inferred 3-dimensional structure.
+ Section 2.4: added footnote concerning correction of [O I] line for airglow contamination.
+ Section 2.6.2: added additional references concerning the 3D location of the star theta 1 Ori D
+ Section 3: correction of 1 km/s to the conversion between heliocentric and LSR frames.
+ Throughout: Text size of labels has been increased in some figures to improve legibility and satisfy editorial guidelines.

Comments to the Author
Referee Report for Manuscript MN-20-5230-MJ
Title: “Raman mapping of photodissociation regions”
Author: W. J. Henney

Summary:
The author demonstrates conclusively that the broad H-alpha emission wings observed throughout the central portions of the Orion nebula are the product of Raman scattering of far-ultraviolet stellar continuum radiation by the wings of the Lyman-beta line of neutral hydrogen atoms, present in the neutral hydrogen domain of photodissociation regions (PDRs) surrounding the ionized inner regions of the nebula. While Raman scattering has been used as a diagnostic tool rather extensively for the study of symbiotic stars, following the introduction of this concept by Nussbaumer et al. (1998), Henney’s new manuscript is only the second time that Raman scattering has been invoked for the analysis of PDR spectra, the first being the paper by Dopita et al. (2016). However, while Dopita et al. suggested that the Ly-beta Raman scattering occurs at the interface between the ionized and neutral gas of PDRs, Henney shows rather definitively that this process occurs throughout the neutral front layer dominated by atomic hydrogen gas. Consequently, Raman scattering can be used to estimate physical conditions in this layer, e.g. the neutral hydrogen density, as was done convincingly by Henney in the present work.

This paper is excellent in every aspect. I recommend that it be published in the Monthly Notices of the RAS. That said I have a brief list of minor comments and suggestions for the author to consider before a final version is submitted.

** Abstract

*** Latex version
#+begin_export latex
  Broad Raman-scattered wings of hydrogen lines can be used to
  map neutral gas illuminated by high-mass stars in star forming regions.
  Raman scattering transforms far-ultraviolet starlight
  from the wings of the \lyb{} line (\SI{1022}{\angstrom} to \SI{1029}{\angstrom})
  to red visual light in the wings of the \ha{} line
  (\SI{6400}{\angstrom} to \SI{6700}{\angstrom}).
  Analysis of spatially resolved spectra of the Orion Bar and other regions
  in the Orion Nebula shows that this process occurs in
  the neutral photo-dissociation region between the ionization front and dissociation front.
  The inner Raman wings are optically thick and allow the neutral hydrogen density
  to be determined, implying  \(n(\chem{H^0}) \approx \SI{e5}{cm^{-3}}\) for the Orion Bar.
  Far-ultraviolet resonance lines of neutral oxygen imprint their absorption
  onto the stellar continuum as it passes through the ionization front,
  producing characteristic absorption lines
  at \SI{6633}{\angstrom} and \SI{6664}{\angstrom} with widths of order \SI{2}{\angstrom}.
  This is a unique signature of Raman scattering, which allows it
  to be easily distinguished from other processes that might produce broad \ha{} wings,
  such as electron scattering or high-velocity outflows.

*** Plain text version
#+begin_example
  Broad Raman-scattered wings of hydrogen lines can be used to map neutral gas illuminated by high-mass stars in star forming regions.  Raman scattering transforms far-ultraviolet starlight from the wings of the Lyman β line (1022 Å to 1029 Å) to red visual light in the wings of the Hɑ line (6400 Å to 6700 Å).  Analysis of spatially resolved spectra of the Orion Bar and other regions in the Orion Nebula shows that this process occurs in the neutral photo-dissociation region between the ionization front and dissociation front.  The inner Raman wings are optically thick and allow the neutral hydrogen density to be determined, implying n(H0) ~= 100,000 per cubic cm for the Orion Bar.  Far-ultraviolet resonance lines of neutral oxygen imprint their absorption onto the stellar continuum as it passes through the ionization front, producing characteristic absorption lines at 6633 Å and 6664 Å with widths of order 2 Å.  This is a unique signature of Raman scattering, which allows it to be easily distinguished from other processes that might produce broad Hɑ wings, such as electron scattering or high-velocity outflows.
