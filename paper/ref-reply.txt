			  RESPONSE TO REFEREE

I am most grateful to the referee for a most helpful report and for the
kind comments about the paper.  I have tried to follow all the
suggestions as detailed below.  Note that I provide a version of the
manuscript with all changes marked in red (appended after the regular
manuscript in the PDF file), which was prepared using the latexdiff
tool.


1. Page 2, Column 2:
====================

  ,----
  | The author appears to be unaware of the fact that the continuum
  | underlying the H-alpha region in the spectrum of the Orion nebula
  | contains a contribution due to extended red emission (ERE).  Perrin &
  | Sivan (1992 A&A 255, 271) published spectra of this emission component
  | for several regions coinciding with those studied by the author. The
  | ERE intensity is comparable to the intensity of dust-scattered
  | starlight, particularly in instances when the dust scattering occurs
  | predominantly at large angles as is the case in edge-on PDRs such as
  | the Orion bar.
  | 
  | Lai et al. (2017 MNRAS 469, 4933) showed that the ERE arises in the
  | same neutral atomic hydrogen domain of PDRs where the Ly-beta Raman
  | scattering occurs.
  | 
  | The ERE spectrum may be quasi-continuous for the purpose of the
  | present study but it has never been examined at comparable spectral
  | resolution. I would not rule out the possibility that some of the
  | unexplained weak spectral features mentioned at the bottom of page 3
  | and some of the problems encountered with the continuum fitting
  | mentioned on page 14 may be a consequence of the ERE and structure
  | within its spectrum.
  `----


  Indeed. Although I had read the Perrin & Sivan paper at some point in
  the past, the ERE is not something I had considered while writing this
  paper.  I am very grateful to the referee for drawing my attention to
  the omission.  I have added a paragraph to the end of section 2.1 to
  address this point.

  | I suggest changing the sub-title “Solid-state absorption features” to
  | “Diffuse interstellar bands”. I suggest the same change in the last
  | portion of Sect. 4.3.2 on Page 16.
  | 	    									  
  | While the carriers of the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) remain
  | largely unidentified (possible exception: identification of ~4 or 5
  | near-IR DIBs with absorptions by C60+), there is a near-unanimous
  | agreement within the DIB community that DIBs are not solid-state
  | absorption features. You can find a fairly detailed review of
  | potential DIB carriers in an article by Snow (2001 Spectrochimica Acta
  | A 57, 615). Lai et al. (2020 MNRAS 492, 5853) demonstrated that DIB
  | carriers survive with normal abundances within the neutral hydrogen
  | domain of PDRs and suggested the possibility that carriers of ERE and
  | DIBs are the same.
  `----


  Yes, this is a good point.  I have made the suggested changes.


5. Page 10, Sect. 2.6.3:
========================

  ,----
  | It would be helpful if a representative nebular spectrum of the
  | wavelength region that includes the DIBs at 5780 Å and 5797 Å were
  | included in this section.
  `----


  This is a very good idea.  I have added a new figure (Fig 7) that
  shows sample spectra for the range 5725 to 5925 angstrom, which
  includes the DIB features and some stellar absorption lines.


6. Page 10, Column 2, line 7:
=============================

  ,----
  | I suggest changing “dust absorption” to “dust extinction”.
  `----


  Agreed. Fixed.


7. Page 15, Column 2, top paragraph:
====================================

  ,----
  | The two limiting dust absorption cross-sections being discussed in
  | this section are significantly (factors 3 – 10) lower than the dust
  | absorption cross-sections found in the diffuse ISM for the Ly-beta
  | wavelength for R_v = 5.5 (Weingartner & Draine 2001 ApJ 548,
  | 296). This suggests to me that dust destruction may have occurred in
  | the Orion bar PDR. The author might want to add a sentence to this
  | effect in this section.
  `----


  In the manuscript I did not carefully distinguish between extinction
  and absorption cross sections here.  It should be the absorption cross
  section that is important for the case of limiting the Raman-scattered
  intensity.  Given that, I think that the value of 5e-22 *is*
  marginally consistent with Weingartner & Draine.  From their Fig 14 I
  find an extinction cross section of roughly 1e-21 at Ly-beta for
  RV=5.5.  From their Fig 15, the albedo is about 0.35, yielding an
  absorption cross section of 6.5e-22.  I have changed the wording to
  try and clarify this and mention the possibility of dust destruction.

  Thank you! Fixed.


Additional changes
==================

  As a result of further reflection and comments from colleagues, I have
  made the following minor additions and changes to the manuscript:

  + Section 1: added more references to previous observations of Raman
    scattering in different astronomical contexts
  + Figures 2, 3 and 8: added two additional regions for spectral
    samples: the Big Arc, which is selected because the Raman scattered
    wings are relatively weak, and the Dark Bay, which is selected as an
    example of high foreground extinction.
  + Section 2.2: by studying the spectrum of the Dark Bay, it becomes
    apparent that some of the previously mysterious absorption features
    in the blue wing of H alpha are probably DIB features.  I discuss
    this here and at the end of section 2.6.3
  + Section 2.4: try to distinguish more carefully between observed
    structure in the plane of the sky and inferred 3-dimensional
    structure.
  + Section 2.4: added footnote concerning correction of [O I] line for
    airglow contamination.
  + Section 2.6.2: added additional references concerning the 3D
    location of the star theta 1 Ori D
  + Section 3: correction of 1 km/s to the conversion between
    heliocentric and LSR frames.
  + Throughout: Text size of labels has been increased in some figures
    to improve legibility and satisfy editorial guidelines.
