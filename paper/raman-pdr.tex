\begin{abstract}
  I show that the broad Raman-scattered wings of H\(\alpha\) can be used to
  map neutral gas illuminated by high-mass stars in star forming
  regions. The near wings
  (\(\Delta\lambda \approx \pm \SI{10}{\angstrom}\)) trace neutral hydrogen columns of
  about \SI{5e20}{cm^{-2}}, while the farther wings
  (\(|\Delta\lambda| > \SI{30}{\angstrom}\)) trace columns of about
  \SI{5e21}{cm^{-2}}. Absorption features in the pseudo-continuum at
  6633 and 6664~\AA{} correspond to neutral oxygen far-ultraviolet
  absorption lines at \SIlist{1027.43;1028.16}{\angstrom}.
  I apply this technique

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/raman-cartoon}
  \caption{Schematic illustration of Raman scattering of photons from
    the \lyb{} wings to the \ha{} wings.  The relevant energy levels
    of neutral hydrogen are shown at left.  Far ultraviolet photons
    that are shifted by about \(\Delta\lambda_1 = \pm 1\) to \SI{3}{\angstrom}
    from the \lyb{} rest wavelength can excite transitions from the
    ground \Config{1s} level to a virtual state adjacent to
    \Config{3p}.  Most such excitations decay back to \Config{1s}
    (Rayleigh scattering), but in about one-fifth of cases the decay
    is to \Config{2s} instead (Raman scattering).  The scattering
    cross section falls approximately as \(\Delta\lambda_1^{-2}\), which gives
    broad Lorentzian wings to the \ha{} line, as shown at right. A
    bandwidth of \(\Delta\lambda_1 = \pm \SI{3}{\angstrom}\) around \lyb{} is
    transformed to a bandwidth
    \(\Delta\lambda_2 \approx \pm \SI{120}{\angstrom}\) around \ha{}.  A narrow
    absorption line in the incident FUV spectrum (vertical thin dashed
    line) becomes a much broader notch in the scattered wings. }
  \label{fig:raman-cartoon}
\end{figure}

Raman scattering is the inelastic analog of Rayleigh scattering by
atoms or molecules.  Both processes begin with a radiation-induced
transition of an electron to a virtual bound state (non-eigenstate).
In Rayleigh scattering, the electron returns to its original state,
resulting in the radiation being re-emitted with its original
frequency (elastic scattering).  In Raman scattering, on the other
hand, the electron undergoes a transition to a different excited
state, resulting in radiation being re-emitted at a much lower
frequency.  See Figure~\ref{fig:raman-cartoon} for an illustration of
the process. Recently, \citet{Dopita:2016a} identified exceedingly
broad wings to the \ha{} \SI{6563}{\angstrom} line in the Orion Nebula
and a number of \hii{} regions in the Magellanic Clouds, which they
ascribe to Raman scattering of ultraviolet radiation in the vicinity
of the \lyb{} \SI{1025}{\angstrom} transition.  Raman scattering in
astrophysical sources was first identified in symbiotic stars
\citep{Schmid:1989a}, where FUV \ion{O}{6} emission lines at
\num{1032} and \SI{1038}{\angstrom} produce broad emission features at
\num{6827} and \SI{7088}{\angstrom}.  This illustrates a curious
feature of Raman scattering \citep{Nussbaumer:1989a}: the relative
width \(\Delta\lambda/\lambda\) of spectral features is amplified by a factor
\(\lambda(\ha)/\lambda(\lyb) \approx 6.4\) when passing from the FUV to the optical
domain.

\citet{Dopita:2016a} propose that the Raman wings form at the
transition zone near the ionization fronts in \hii{} regions.
However, the total neutral hydrogen column through the ionization
front can be no more than about
\(10 / \sigma_0 \approx \SI{2e18}{cm^{-2}}\), where
\(\sigma_0 \approx \SI{6.3e-18}{cm^2}\) is the ground-state hydrogen
photoionization cross section at threshold \citep{Osterbrock:2006a}.
The Raman scattering cross section at wavelengths responsible for the
observed wings is much lower than this:
\(\sigma\Raman \sim \SI{e-21}{cm^2}\) \citep{Chang:2015a}, meaning that the
Raman scattering optical depth through the ionization front is only of
order \(0.001\).  A vastly larger column density of neutral hydrogen
(\(\approx \SI{e21}{cm^{-2}}\)) is available in the photodissociation region
(PDR) outside the ionization front, so it is more likely that Raman
scattering will occur there instead, so long as there is sufficient
far ultraviolet radiative flux.

This paper is organized as follows. \S~\ref{sec:raman-theory}
recapitulates the basic theory of Raman scattering, concentrating on
the wavelength transformation from the FUV domain around \lyb{} to
optical domain around \ha{}.  In addition, polynomial fits are
provided to the wavelength dependence of the total (Rayleigh plus
Raman) scattering cross section and the Raman \ha{} branching
ratio. \S~\ref{sec:muse-spectr-mapp} then presents archival VLT-MUSE
integral field spectroscopy of the Orion Nebula, which allows the
broad H\(\alpha\) wings to be spatially mapped in unprecedented detail and
compared with other tracers of ionized and neutral zones in the
nebula.  Two components of the \ion{O}{1} UV resonance multiplet
\(\Term{2p^4}{3}{P} \to \Term{3d}{3}{D^o}\) are detected as absorption
features at \num{6633} and \SI{6664}{\angstrom} against the \ha{}
Raman wings.  \S~\ref{sec:keck-observations} presents archival
Keck-HIRES slit spectroscopy, which shows the profile of the
\SI{6664}{\angstrom} absorption line with an effective velocity
resolution of \SI{1}{km.s^{-1}}.  \S~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses
the implications of these results for the structure and dynamics of
the PDRs in Orion, together with the prospects for using Raman
spectral mapping as a diagnostic tool in the study of other high-mass
star formation regions.

\section{Spectral mapping of Raman wings}
\label{sec:muse-spectr-mapp}

    outer layers of the photoionized nebula; and [\ion{O}{3}]
    \(\lambda5007\) (blue channel), which traces the highly ionized interior
    of the nebula. }
  \label{fig:raman-fov-regions}
\end{figure}
The principal observational dataset used in this paper is the imaging
spectroscopy mosaic of the inner Orion Nebula \citep{Weilbacher:2015a,
  Mc-Leod:2015b} obtained with the MUSE spectrograph
\citep{Bacon:2010a, Bacon:2014a} on the VLT.  The entire datacube
covers the wavelength range \num{4595} to \SI{9366}{\angstrom} but we
concentrate mainly on the range \num{6300} to \SI{6800}{\angstrom},
where the spectral resolving power is \(R \approx 2500\), corresponding to
an instrumental linewidth (FWHM) of
\(\delta\lambda \approx \SI{2.4}{\angstrom}\), which is sampled at
\SI{1.25}{\angstrom.pix^{-1}} and then resampled to
\SI{0.85}{\angstrom.pix^{-1}} for the final calibrated cube
\citetext{see \S~2 of \citealp{Weilbacher:2015a}}.  The observed field
is shown by the white rectangle in
Figure~\ref{fig:raman-fov-regions}(a) and includes the entire inner
Huygens region of the nebula, which accounts for roughly half of the
total radio continuum flux from the \hii{} region
\citep{Subrahmanyan:2001a}.  The full datacube is a mosaic that
combines observations from 30 separate pointings, with a pixel size of
\(0.2 \times 0.2''\).

\subsection{Raman scattered \boldmath\ha{} wings}
\label{sec:raman-scattered-ha}

\begin{figure*}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/raman-orion-muse-1d-spectra}
  \caption{MUSE spectra of the Orion Nebula centered on the
    H\(\alpha\) line, showing the broad Raman-scattered wings.  Spectra are
    shown for the regions outlined by white boxes in
    Figure~\ref{fig:raman-fov-regions} and were extracted from the
    datacubes of \citet{Weilbacher:2015a}. All spectra are normalized
    to the continuum at \SI{6200}{\angstrom} and are offset vertically
    as labelled at right. Emission line identifications are shown by
    solid vertical lines, labelled above for weak lines and below for
    stronger lines.  Wavelengths of Raman-scattered \ion{O}{1} and
    \ion{Si}{2} absorption lines from
    Table~\ref{tab:raman-wavelengths} are shown by red dashed vertical
    lines, labelled in bold font below, together with unidentified
    candidate absorption features marked with ``?''.  Dotted lines
    show night sky lines identified in the Dark Bay region of the
    nebula.  At the bottom of the figure are shown the theoretical
    upper-atmosphere airglow spectrum (green line) and telluric
    molecular absorption spectrum (red line), as calculated from the
    Cerro Paranal Advanced Sky Model \citep{Noll:2012a,
      Moehler:2014a}.  }
  \label{fig:raman-spectra-1d}
\end{figure*}

Extended wings to the \ha{} line are detected over the entire map, but
they are particularly prominent in the six regions marked as white
boxes in Figure~\ref{fig:raman-fov-regions}(b).  These are all
bar-like features \citep{ODell:2000a, Garcia-Diaz:2007a}, which
correspond to filamentary ionization fronts.  Extracted MUSE spectra
around the \ha{} line for each of these regions are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:raman-spectra-1d}.  All regions show broad wings to
the \ha{} line extending from \num{6300} to \SI{6700}{\angstrom},
which are consistent with the higher spectral resolution
(\(R = 7000\)) results of \citet{Dopita:2016a} for the region
indicated by a dashed box in Figure~\ref{fig:raman-fov-regions}(b).
The continuum is interpolated under the wings by fitting a
second-order polynomial to clean regions of the spectra in the ranges
\SIrange{6070}{6225}{\angstrom} and \SIrange{6760}{6820}{\angstrom},
as shown by the lower edge of the gray shading for each spectrum.  The
continuum is a combination of Paschen recombination emission from
hydrogen, which increases to the red, and dust-scattered starlight and
two-photon hydrogen emission, which both increase to the blue.  The
combined \(F_\lambda\) is approximately flat for all regions except the
Orion Bar, where dust scattering of the nearby star \th2A{} dominates,
resulting in a blueward rise.  All of these continuum processes are
expected to be smooth on a \SI{100}{\angstrom} scale,\footnote{The
  only exception is the dust-scattered \ha{} line from the stellar
  photospheres and winds, but this is confined within
  \(\pm \SI{30}{\angstrom}\) of the rest wavelength (see Fig.~2 of
  \citealp{Simon-Diaz:2006b}) and so does not affect the Raman wings,
  which are broader than that.}  but nonetheless the systematic
uncertainties in the continuum interpolation is an important factor
that limits the precision of the Raman wing measurements.

\subsection{Raman scattered FUV absorption lines}
\label{sec:raman-scattered-fuv}
A prominent feature of all the spectra in
Figure~\ref{fig:raman-spectra-1d} is a pair of absorption notches in
the red wing at \SI{6633}{\angstrom} and \SI{6664}{\angstrom}, which
closely correspond to the wavelengths expected for the Raman-scattered
transformation of the \ion{O}{1} resonance lines at
\SI{1027}{\angstrom} and \SI{1028}{\angstrom} listed in
Table~\ref{tab:raman-wavelengths}.  After correcting for instrumental
broadening, the FWHM of the \SI{6633}{\angstrom} feature is
\(\approx \SI{2.5}{\angstrom}\), which would correspond to a velocity width
of \SI{115}{km.s^{-1}} if it were an optical absorption line.
However, taking into account the wavelength transformation during
Raman scattering (eq.~[\ref{eq:wav-transform}]), the true velocity
width of the FUV line is \SI{18}{km.s^{-1}}.  The absorption depth of
the features is roughly 50\% with respect to the Raman-scattered wing
at adjacent wavelengths, but is much lower with respect to the total
continuum emission.  The same spectral features are also visible in
the \citet{Dopita:2016a} spectra but are not commented on by those
authors. The \SI{6664}{\angstrom} feature is partially blended with
the [\ion{Ni}{2}] \SI{6666.8}{\angstrom} nebular emission line in the
MUSE spectra, but these are better resolved in the higher resolution
\citeauthor{Dopita:2016a} spectra.  Archival Keck HIRES observations
of this feature at an even higher spectral resolution are presented
below in \S~\ref{sec:keck-observations}.  The identification of these
two FUV absorption lines in the optical spectrum is incontestable
proof of a Raman scattering origin for the broad \ha{} wings.

There is also evidence for a weak absorption feature in the blue wing
at \SI{6481}{\angstrom}, corresponding to the \ion{Si}{2} absorption
line at \SI{1024}{\angstrom}.  However, the blue wing is much less
clean than the red wing, partly due to telluric absorption and airglow
emission (see below), which makes the identification uncertain.  The
Raman wings show some other weak features that remain unidentified,
the strongest of which is an apparent broad
(\(\approx \SI{5}{\angstrom}\)) absorption feature at \SI{6494}{\angstrom},
while additional narrower features are seen at \SI{6450}{\angstrom}
and \SI{6708}{\angstrom} (all marked with ``?'' in
Figure~\ref{fig:raman-spectra-1d}).  It is not clear if these are
truly absorption features or whether they are simply gaps between very
weak blended emission lines.

    }
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}


In order to study the spatial distribution of the Raman-scattered
wings, it is convenient to define a series of broad bands on the blue
and red sides, which are listed in Table~\ref{tab:wav-bands} and shown
as blue and red shaded vertical stripes in
Figure~\ref{fig:raman-spectra-1d}. Four bands are defined in each
wing, spanning a range in \(|\Delta\lambda_2|\) from about \SI{30}{\angstrom} to
\SI{150}{\angstrom}.  The lower limit of this range is determined by
overlap with the strong nebular [\ion{N}{2}] emission lines, while the
upper limit is due the [\ion{S}{2}] lines on the red side, combined
with the Raman wings becoming too weak to measure.  The mean
\chem{H^0} \lyb{} cross section corresponding to each band
(eq.~[\ref{eq:total-cross-section-fit}]) is also given in the table,
varying between about \SI{1e-22}{cm^2} and \SI{2e-21}{cm^2}.

The bands are chosen so as to avoid the strongest contaminating lines
wherever possible, but some small contamination is unavoidable, as
listed in the rightmost column of the table.  The contamination comes
from two sources: weak nebular emission lines (indicated by solid
vertical lines in Figure~\ref{fig:raman-spectra-1d}) and additionally
from the line absorption and emission of the Earth's atmosphere.  Two
complementary methods were used to investigate this latter effect.
First, the datacube was inspected to identify lines with roughly
uniform brightness across the entire map.  In particular, any line
that is as strong in the Dark Bay region as it is in Orion~S is
unlikely to come from the nebula itself.  Such lines are indicated by
vertical dotted lines in Figure~\ref{fig:raman-spectra-1d} and some
are listed in Table~\ref{tab:wav-bands}.  Second, ESO's SkyCalc
tool\footnote{\url{http://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipelines/skytools/skycalc}}
was used to predict theoretical emission and absorption spectra for
the atmosphere above the VLT at the time and airmass of the
observations, convolved with the MUSE instrumental profile.  The
emission spectrum is dominated by upper-atmosphere airglow lines of
\chem{OH} \citep{Osterbrock:1996a, Noll:2012a, Noll:2014a}, shown in
green in the figure, many of which can be seen to coincide with the
empirically determined sky lines.  The absorption spectrum is
dominated by telluric lines of \chem{O_2} and \chem{H_2 O}
\citep{Moehler:2014a, Smette:2015a}.  The strongest predicted
absorption near \ha{} is the \chem{O_2} \(\gamma\) band at
\SI{6280}{\angstrom}, which is clearly seen in all the spectra, with
an absorption depth of order \num{0.1}, but lies well away from the
Raman wings.  The blue Raman wing is affected by weaker \chem{H_2 O}
bands at \SIrange{6460}{6600}{\angstrom} with absorption depth
\(< 0.01\), as compared to the relative brightness of the Raman wings
at those wavelengths, which is \numrange{0.05}{0.1}.

In summary, the nebular and telluric contamination introduces
uncertainties of order 10\% in the fluxes of the B033, B054, and B080
bands, with other bands being affected to a much lesser degree.

\subsection{Spatial distribution of Raman band emission}
\label{sec:spat-mapp-raman}
\begin{figure*}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/raman-rgb-4-panel}
  \caption{Spatial distribution of Raman-scattered wings of

    (red channel), B054 (green), B033 (blue).  All bands are

    (red, purple, and blue contours for different LSR velocities as
    marked).}
  \label{fig:raman-maps}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:raman-maps} shows maps of the six innermost Raman
bands as two RGB images: the blue wing in panel~a and the red wing in
panel~b.  In each case, the channel sequence R, G, B is an inward
progression towards line center, from the farther wings to the nearer
wings.  The maps are adaptively smoothed following the binary grid
algorithm outlined in \citet{Garcia-Diaz:2018a}, which reduces the
noise in the fainter regions at the cost of a reduced spatial
resolution.  The two maps are strikingly similar, indicating that the
contamination of the blue wing (see previous section) is indeed a
minor effect when integrated over an entire band.

To aid in the interpretation of the Raman wing maps,
Figure~\ref{fig:raman-maps}c shows a combined view of
mid-to-low-ionization oxygen emission lines, derived from the MUSE
data cube.  In blue is shown the [\ion{O}{2}]
\(7318.39, \SI{7319.99}{\angstrom}\) doublet, which traces the outer
10\% of the fully ionized emission.  In green is shown the
[\ion{O}{1}] \SI{6300.30}{\angstrom} line, which principally traces
partially ionized gas at the ionization front, but also shocks in
neutral gas. In red is shown the fluorescent \ion{O}{1}
\SI{8446.36}{\angstrom} line, which traces fully neutral gas that is
very close behind the ionization front.  This image clearly
illustrates that the neutral/molecular gas is organized in filaments,
with bright ionization fronts on the side facing the high-mass
Trapezium stars. This is most clearly seen in the Orion Bar, the
linear emission feature to the south-east of the map, but analogous
filaments are seen in all directions from the Trapezium (see also
Figure~\ref{fig:raman-fov-regions}b).  A particularly complex region,
with several partially overlapping filaments, lies between the
Trapezium and the Orion~S star formation region.  This region shows
the brightest Raman wing emission, suggesting that it contains the
neutral gas with the highest incident FUV flux, presumably because it
lies physically closest to the illuminating high-mass stars.

The spatial relation of the Raman-scattered wings to other emission
lines is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:raman-maps}d, which shows the
summed wing intensity over all 8 bands as a false color scale. This is
compared with contours that show the ionization front, as traced by
the collisionally excited [\ion{O}{1}] line, and molecular gas, as
traced by the optically thick \chem{^{12}CO} (1--0) line
\citep{Kong:2018a}.  In the Bar region, the Raman emission is clearly
seen to be sandwiched between the ionization front and the molecular
gas, conclusive evidence that it arises in the neutral zone of the
PDR.\@ In the Orion~S region and around the Trapezium, there is not
such a clear stratification between ionized, neutral, and molecular
emission.  This is due to two factors: first, the densities are
higher, which shortens all length scales, and second, the geometry is
not so edge-on, leading to a greater degree of superposition along the
line of sight, as witnessed by the overlap of the [\ion{O}{1}] and
\chem{^{12}CO} contours.  Nonetheless, even here there is evidence
that the Raman emission tends to lie farther from \th1C{} than the
ionization front, particularly in the ``SW minibar'' region.

Figure~\ref{fig:raman-bar-profile} shows spatial profiles across the
Orion Bar of the Raman-scattered bands (panel a), together with other
emission lines and bands (panels b and c). In keeping with the
dominant tradition in the literature \citetext{e.g., Fig.~9 of
  \citealp{van-der-Werf:1996a}, Fig.~2 of \citealp{Goicoechea:2017a}},
the molecular regions are shown on the left and the ionized regions on
the right.  The profiles are the median values across a slit of width
\(75''\), as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:raman-bar-profile}d.
Table~\ref{tab:bar-profile-peaks} shows the positions, widths, and
intensities of the peaks in each tracer, as determined by fitting a
single Gaussian plus a linear background.

\subsubsection{Lines from ionized gas and the ionization front at the Bar}
\label{sec:lines-from-ionized}


The ionization stratification at the edge of the \ion{H}{2} region is
clearly seen in the distribution of the [\ion{O}{3}], [\ion{O}{2}],
[\ion{O}{1}], and \ion{O}{1} lines
(Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-bar-profile}c).  The peak in [\ion{O}{1}]
emissivity (excited by collisions between electrons and neutral oxygen
atoms) is expected to occur at a hydrogen ionization fraction of 50\%
\citep{Henney:2005b}, which is displaced by
\(x_0 \approx \SI{-1.7}{mpc}\) from the peak of the \ion{O}{1} fluorescent
line.  This latter should correspond to an absorption optical depth of
approximately unity in the FUV pumping lines, such as those listed in
Table~\ref{tab:raman-wavelengths} \citetext{see \S~5 of
  \citealp{Walmsley:2000a}}, corresponding to a neutral hydrogen
column density of \(N(\chem{H^0}) \approx \SI{1e19}{cm^{-2}}\) and therefore
an average volume density of
\(n(\chem{H^0}) = N(\chem{H^0}) / |x_0| \approx \SI{2000}{cm^{-3}}\).  This
value is similar to the peak electron density on the fully ionized
side of the ionization front: \(n_e \approx \SI{3000}{cm^{-3}}\), measured
from the [\ion{S}{2}] \(6717/6731\) ratio \citep[e.g.][]{ODell:2017b},
which occurs at \(x \approx \SI{-7}{mpc}\), close to the peak in the
[\ion{O}{2}] emission. Therefore, the \emph{total} hydrogen density is
roughly constant over the transition between a predominantly ionized
state and predominantly neutral state.  Note that the apparent width
of this transition (for instance, the FWHM of the [\ion{O}{1}] peak
\(\approx \SI{9}{mpc}\)) is much larger than predicted by atomic physics,
which is probably due to spatial irregularities in the ionization
front, which can be seen in the inset
Figure~\ref{fig:raman-bar-profile}d and is discussed in more detail in
\S~\ref{sec:structure-orion-bar} below.



\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/raman-band-displacements-plot}

    \(\tau = 1\) for 3 different constant neutral hydrogen densities, as
    indicated in the legend. }
  \label{fig:raman-band-displacements}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Spatial profiles of the Raman bands in the neutral Bar}
\label{sec:spat-prof-raman}
Unlike the optical emission lines, the Raman wing bands (upper panel
of Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-bar-profile}) all show peaks at positive values
of \(x\), corresponding to fully neutral gas in the PDR.\@ There is a
very close agreement between corresponding pairs of blue and red
bands: B033 with R040, B054 with R058, and B080 with R087.  However,
there is a systematic tendency for the blue band intensity to be
slightly higher than its red counterpart on the ionized side (negative
values of \(x\)), which is probably due to contamination by nebular
emission lines, as listed in column~7 of
Table~\ref{tab:wav-bands}. There is a clear tendency for the peak in
the brightness profile to progress towards greater depths into the
neutral gas as one moves to wavelengths farther from the \ha{} line
center, which is quantitatively confirmed by the Gaussian fits in
Table~\ref{tab:bar-profile-peaks}.  If the peak emission occurs for a
\lyb{} wing optical depth of \(\tau \approx 1\) for each band, then the
displacement from the ionization front should vary as
\(x_0 \approx (n \langle \sigma_\lambda \rangle)^{-1}\), where \(n\) is the neutral hydrogen
density in the PDR and \(\langle \sigma_\lambda \rangle\) is the \lyb{} wing cross section
for the FUV wavelengths that pump each band, which is given in
column~6 of Table~\ref{tab:wav-bands}.  In
Figure~\ref{fig:raman-band-displacements}, this relationship is tested
under the assumption that \(n\) is constant over the depth range
\SIrange{2}{8}{mpc}, where it can be seen that a PDR density of order
\(n \sim \SI{1e5}{cm^{-3}}\) is required to fit the observations.  A
systematic uncertainty of 10\% of the width of each emission peak is
assigned to the \(x_0\) values, which has the largest relative impact
on the near-wing bands: B033 and R040.  As a result, it is the B054
and R058 bands that are the most reliable indicators, yielding
\(n = \SI{8.5e4}{cm^{-3}}\) (dotted line).  The bands in the farther
wings fall below this curve, significantly so for B133 and R136, but
this can be understood as due to two factors.  First, the finite total
\chem{H^0} column through the PDR means that the wings will become
optically thin for a sufficiently low
\(\langle \sigma_\lambda \rangle\), in which case \(\tau = 1\) can no longer hold.  Second,
competition with dust grains for the absorption of FUV photons will
become significant when
\(\langle \sigma_\lambda \rangle < \sigma_{\text{dust}}\).  These issues are discussed further in
\S~\ref{sec:discussion}.

\subsubsection{Other PDR tracers of the neutral and molecular Bar}
\label{sec:other-pdr-tracers}

\newcommand\vibro[3]{\ensuremath{v = #1 \to #2\ \mathrm{#3}}}

The left hand side of panels b and c of
Figure~\ref{fig:raman-bar-profile} show a variety of other emission
lines and continuum bands, which trace different layers in the PDR.\@
The near-infrared \chem{H_2} \vibro{1}{0}{S(1)} line marks the
hydrogen dissociation front \cite{van-der-Werf:1996a, Luhman:1998a, Marconi:1998a}, which provides the outer boundary of the neutral hydrogen layer.e 


The principal tracers of the

In summary, 



The 21~cm \ion{H}{1} line \citep{van-der-Werf:2013a} probes deeper
zones of the PDR than the Raman scattering, since it peaks at the
position of the \chem{H_2} emission.

  \label{fig:raman-keck}
\end{figure*}

In order to obtain observations of the Raman-scattered \ion{O}{1} absorption lines
at high spectral resolution, I have searched through archival spectra
of the Orion Nebula obtained with the HIRES spectrograph on the Keck~I telescope
\citep{Vogt:1994a}.
The observations, obtained in 1997 December~5 and 6,
were targeted at a small number of proplyds and jets in the nebula
and are described in detail in \citet{Henney:1999a} and \citet{Bally:2000a}.
Unfortunately, the stronger \SI{6633}{\angstrom} feature falls in a gap between adjacent spectrograph orders and so was not observed.
However, the weaker \SI{6664}{\angstrom} feature falls in order~53 and is detected in many of the spectra.
Results for the proplyds will be presented elsewhere,
and I concentrate here on 16 slit positions located in the Orion~South region,
roughly \SI{30}{arcsec} SW of the Trapezium.
Closely similar slit positions are co-added to improve S/N, 
forming four groups, A, B, C, and D, with positions shown in Figure~\ref{fig:zoom-keck}.
Most of the slits are \SI{28}{arcsec} long and \SI{0.574}{arcsec} wide,
but only the central \SI{11}{arcsec} of order~53 is usable for faint lines
due to overlap of adjacent orders.\footnote{
  One slit in Group~A is \SI{14}{arcsec} long and does not suffer any order overlap.
}

The broad Raman-scattered wings to \ha{} are spread over several spectrograph orders
and uncertainties in the flat-field correction means that it is impossible to separate the wings from the nebular continuum.
Therefore, I simply fit a 5th-order polynomial to line-free sections of the spectrum
over the entire order (\SI{6649}{\angstrom} to \SI{6747}{\angstrom}) and divide
to give a continuum-normalized spectrum.
Results for the four groups are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:raman-keck} for the wavelength range of interest.

Geometry of bar: in \citet{Henney:2005b} I pointed out that a
diverging cylindrical geometry is necessary to explain the sharp peak
in the [\ion{N}{2}] emissivity seen at the ionization front.  It has
been apparent since \citet{ODell:2000a} that the nebula contains many
bar-like features.

\citet{Salgado:2016a} had found low dust cross-section in Orion Bar
PDR, but there are loopholes. First, they assume plane-parallel
geometry with exactly edge-on viewing angle, while in reality it is a
roughly cylindrical filament.  Second, they ignore scattering, see
\citet{Watson:1998a}.  Also, density increase with depth

\subsection{Rival explanations for the 6633, 6664 lines}
\label{sec:rival-expl-6633}

No stellar absorption lines there \citep{Simon-Diaz:2006b}.  Too broad to be atomic or ionic absorption line.  So strong it would have to be a resonance line.  Could be solid-state feature, such as DIBs, but at that wavelength there are only weak features that are seen at very high extinction columns.  Would have to be imprinted during back-scattering so as not to be seen in the stellar spectra. 

\subsection{Miscellany}
\label{sec:miscellany}



The effective resolving power of the optical spectrograph is multiplied by 6.4 for the FUV domain.

The \ion{O}{1} lines should be in absorption in the spectrum seen by the Raman scatterers. 

Non-equilibrium PDRs \citep{Stoerzer:1998a, Bertoldi:1996a}.  Recent models from \citet{Bron:2018a}. 

\ion{C}{1} emission from non-steady PDRs \citep{Stoerzer:1997a} (fine structure lines, but maybe optical lines would be similar).  \citet{Escalante:1991a} model the far-red [\ion{C}{1}] line as recombination of \chem{C^+}.


\ion{O}{6} 1037.62, 1031.93 absorption line in wind. No evidence for
a blue absorption edge at \(V = \SI{1200}{km.s^{-1}}\), which would be at
\(\lambda_2 = \SI{6649}{\angstrom}\), right in middle of R087 band.


Even for high PDR optical depth, no multiple Raman scattering will
occur since the population of \(2s\) is very small and the
post-scattered photons have insufficient energy to excite any
transitions from \(1s\).

When a photon is Raman-scattered from the vicinity of \lyb{} (UV
domain) to the vicinity of \ha{} (optical domain) its wavelength is
transformed from \(\lambda_1\) to \(\lambda_2\).  Intervals in frequency
(\(\nu = c/\lambda\)) or wavenumber (\(\wn = 1 / \lambda\)) space are conserved
between the two domains. For example the wavenumber displacement from
the \ion{H}{1} line center can be written in two ways:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:delta-wavnum}
  \Delta\wn = \wn_1 - \wn(\lyb) = \wn_2 - \wn(\ha) \ ,
\end{equation}
from which it follows that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:wav-transform}
  \lambda_2 = \left( \frac1{\lambda(\ha)} +\frac1{\lambda_1} - \frac1{\lambda(\lyb)}\right)^{-1} \ .
\end{equation}
The wavelengths \(\lambda(\lyb)\) and \(\lambda(\ha)\), together with their
corresponding wavenumbers, are given in
Table~\ref{tab:raman-wavelengths} (all wavelengths are on the vacuum
scale unless otherwise noted).  For both lines, a weighted average
over the \Level{3p}{2}{P}{1/2} and \Level{3p}{2}{P}{3/2} upper levels
is used, assumed to be populated according to their statistical
weights, with individual component wavelengths obtained from
Tab.~XXVIII of \citet{Mohr:2008a}. Note that the electric dipole
selection rules mean that only \Config{3p \to 2s} transitions contributer
to \ha{} in the Raman scattering context.  The wavelength is therefore
slightly shorter than the value obtained for the \ha{} recombination
line, which includes additional contributions from \Config{3s \to 2p}
and \Config{3d \to 2p}. The shift is of order \SI{-0.05}{\angstrom} or
\SI{-2}{km.s^{-1}} with respect to the Case~B results reported in
Tab.~6a of \citet{Clegg:1999a}.

Also listed in Table~\ref{tab:raman-wavelengths} are the Raman
transformations \(\lambda_1 \to \lambda_2\) for the rest wavelengths of transitions
between the ground \Term{2s^2 2p^4}{3}{P} term of neutral
\chem{^{16}O} and the excited \Term{2s^2 2p^3 3d}{3}{D^o} term. The
\ion{O}{1} data is obtained from highly accurate laser metrology
\citep{Ivanov:2008a, Marinov:2017a}, with a precision of
\SI{0.08}{cm^{-1}} or better.  The fine structure splitting between
the \(J_k\) levels of the excited term (\(\sim \SI{0.1}{cm^{-1}}\)) is
much smaller than that between the \(J_i\) levels of the ground term
(\(\sim \SI{100}{cm^{-2}}\)), so that the 6 transitions fall into 3
well-separated groups.  The three transitions from the lowest energy
\(J_i=2\) level are very close to \lyb{}
(\(\Delta\wn \approx \SI{4}{cm^{-1}}\)), whereas the two transitions from
\(J_i=1\) (\(\Delta\wn \approx \SI{162}{cm^{-1}}\)) and the single transition
from \(J_i=0\) (\(\Delta\wn \approx \SI{231}{cm^{-1}}\)) lie increasingly to the
red.  The corresponding wavelengths in the optical domain,
\(\lambda_2\), are therefore on the red side of \ha{}.  The final column of
the table uses STP refractive indices \citep{Greisen:2006a} to convert
\(\lambda_2\) to air wavelengths, \(\lambda_{\text{air}}\), for ease of comparison
with ground-based optical spectroscopy.  The resultant wavelength is
\SI{6663.747}{\angstrom} for the line from \(J_i = 0\), with an
uncertainty of about \SI{0.004}{\angstrom}, which is much smaller than
typical observational precision (for instance, \SI{0.07}{\angstrom}
for a very high resolution spectrograph with resolving power of
\(R = \num{e5}\)). The two lines from \(J_i = 1\), with a separation
of \SI{0.028}{\angstrom}, will always be blended in observations,
giving a mean wavelength of \SI{6633.347}{\angstrom} (assuming the
upper levels are distributed according to statistical weight
\(2 J_k + 1\)).  Similarly, the three lines from \(J_i = 2\) have a
mean wavelength of \SI{6564.386}{\angstrom}, but this is so close to
\ha{} (corresponding to a Doppler shift of \SI{+75}{km.s^{-1}}) that
it would be very difficult to observe.

The final section of Table~\ref{tab:raman-wavelengths} gives data for
a resonance doublet of \chem{Si^+} whose components lie a few
\si{\angstrom} to the blue of \lyb{}.  The shorter of the two
components is Raman-transformed to
\(\lambda_{\text{air}} = \SI{6362.35}{\angstrom}\), which unfortunately
coincides with the collisionally excited [\ion{O}{1}] line at
\SI{6363.78}{\angstrom}.  The longer component is transformed to
\SI{6480.81}{\angstrom} in a region that is clear of any strong
nebular lines.  Wavelengths for these lines are based on energy levels
from \citet{Martin:1983a}, with an estimated precision of
\SI{0.1}{cm^{-1}}, which gives an uncertainty in the optical
wavelengths \(\lambda_2\) of \SI{0.04}{\angstrom}.

The total cross-section for the off-resonance \Config{1s \to 3p}
transition in \chem{H^0} is calculated in \S~2 of \citet{Chang:2015a}
from second order time-dependent perturbation theory. Results are
presented in the upper panel of Figure~1 of that paper in terms of a
Doppler velocity factor \(\Delta V_1\), which in the notation of the
current paper is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:chang-DeltaV1}
  \Delta V_1 = c \left( \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda(\lyb)} - 1 \right) \ .
\end{equation}
The observed Raman-scattered wings of \ha{} that are analyzed below
are typically within \(\Delta\lambda_2 \sim \pm \SI{100}{\angstrom}\) of the line
core.  It is therefore convenient to define a dimensionless wavelength
in the optical domain as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:x-optical-def}
  x = \frac{\lambda_2 - \lambda(\ha)}{\SI{100}{\angstrom}} \ ,
\end{equation}
which corresponds to \(x \approx \Delta V_1 / \SI{714}{km.s^{-1}}\) in the FUV
domain.  The total cross section in the range \(0.4 < |x| < 2.3\) can
then be fit as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:total-cross-section-fit}
  \frac{\sigma}{\SI{e-21}{cm^2}} =  
  \begin{cases}
    0.2186 x^{-2} - 0.0344 x^{-1} - 0.0054 & \text{if \(x < 0\)} \\
    0.2367 x^{-2} - 0.0187 x^{-1} + 0.0041 & \text{if \(x > 0\)} 
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Note that separate fits are given for the blue (\(x < 0\)) and red
(\(x > 0\)) wings of \ha{} since the cross section, although
approximately Lorentzian, is not exactly symmetric, being stronger on
the blue side (by about 10\% for \(x = \pm 1\)).

The fraction of all \Config{1s \to 3p} excitations that result in Raman
scattering to an optical photon is given by the branching ratio,
\(f_{\ha}\), with the remaining fraction, \(1 - f_{\ha}\), resulting
in elastic Rayleigh scattering in which the photon remains in the FUV
domain.  The results for \(f_{\ha}\) are also shown in Figure~1 of
\citet{Chang:2015a} and can be fit as follows in the range
\(|x| < 5\):
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fha-fit}
  f_{\ha} = 0.2238 + 0.0363 x + 0.0024 x^2 \ .
\end{equation}
The relative accuracy of all these fits is better than 1\% within the
stated range (corresponding to
\(\sigma \approx \text{\SIrange{e-22}{e-21}{cm^2}}\)), which is perfectly
adequate for the purposes of this paper.  Note that the branching
ratio increases with \(x\), which means that the product
\(\sigma f_{\ha} \) is stronger on the red side of \ha{}.

\section{\boldmath Reanalysis of \SI{21}{cm} \ion{H}{1} observations of the Orion Bar}
\label{sec:reanalysis-21-cm}

Karl G.\ Jansky Very Large Array observations of the \ion{H}{1}
\SI{21}{cm} line from the Orion Nebula and its surroundings at a
spatial resolution of \(\approx 6''\) and a velocity resolution of
\SI{0.77}{km.s^{-1}} were presented in \citet[hereafter
vdW13]{van-der-Werf:2013a}.  The line is seen both in emission and
absorption of the strong free-free continuum emitted by the ionized
nebula.  The majority of the absorption arises in the foreground Veil
at Local Standard of Rest velocities of
\(\vlsr = \text{\SIrange{-2}{+7}{km.s^{-1}}}\). Emission is seen
primarily at more redshifted velocities of
\SIrange{+10}{+15}{km.s^{-1}}, similar to the velocities of the
molecular gas seen in CO, although at large distances from the center
of the nebula the Veil is also seen in emission.  The analysis of the
absorption components by \vdw{} was carried out under the assumptions
that (i)~all of the continuum emission arises from \emph{behind} the
absorbing \chem{H^0} column (from the point of view of the Earth), and
(ii)~line emission is negligible at velocities where absorption is
detected.  These are both very good assumptions in the case of
absorption by the foreground Veil, but they break down for the case of
the Orion Bar, where both emission and absorption are seen at similar
velocities and in spatially adjacent regions.  Given the wealth of
information on the physical conditions and geometry that these data
provide, it is worth reanalyzing them under less restrictive
assumptions.

  \caption{Three-layer sandwich structure for \ion{H}{1} \SI{21}{cm} radiative transfer.}
  \label{fig:hii-hi-hii-sandwich}
\end{figure}

In the Rayleigh--Jeans limit, the frequency-dependent surface
brightness \(I_\nu\) is characterized by the brightness temperature in
each velocity channel: \(T_{\mathrm{b}}(v) = c^2 I_\nu / 2 k \nu^2\),
where \(v/c = (\nu/\nu_0) - 1\) and \(\nu_0 = \SI{1.420405}{GHz}\).  The
radiative transfer equation can be solved for an idealized three-layer
sandwich structure (see Fig.~\ref{fig:hii-hi-hii-sandwich}),
consisting of (1)~a background \chem{H^+} region with electron
temperature \Te{} and free-free continuum optical depth \(\tau'\), (2)~an
intermediate neutral \chem{H^0} layer with spin temperature \Ts{} and
line optical depth \(\tau(v)\), and (3)~a foreground \chem{H^+} region
with the electron temperature \Te{} and free-free continuum optical
depth \(\tau''\). The continuum source function in regions~1 and~3 is
\Te{}, whereas the line source function in region~2 is \Ts{}.
Region~2 is assumed to have zero continuum optical depth.  Following
\vdw{}, large-scale Milky Way \ion{H}{1} line emission along the line
of sight through Orion is neglected since it is (a)~very faint
compared with the nebula, with \(\Tb(v) < \SI{48}{K} \) at
\(v = \SI{10}{km.s^{-1}}\) \citep{Green:1991a, Green:1993a}, and
(b)~any emission that is smooth on angular scales below 7 arcminutes
will be filtered out by the interferometer.
 
At continuum frequencies just off the line, \(\tau(v) = 0\) and only
regions~1 and 3 contribute to the observed brightness, yielding a
continuum brightness temperature
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:Tcont}
  \Tc & = \Te \biggl( 1 - e^{-(\tau' + \tau'')} \biggr) \\
  & = \Tc' e^{-\tau''} + \Tc''
  \ , \nonumber
\end{align}
where the second equality gives the decomposition into separate
contributions from region~1: \(\Tc' = \Te (1 - e^{-\tau'})\), and
region~3: \(\Tc'' = \Te (1 - e^{-\tau''})\).  At frequencies where the
line opacity is significant, all three regions contribute, yielding
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Tline}
  \Tb(v) =
    \Tc' e^{-\left(\tau(v) + \tau''\right)} +
    \Ts \biggl( 1 - e^{-\tau(v)} \biggr) e^{-\tau''} +
    \Tc''
  \ .
\end{equation}
For practical reasons related to the deconvolution of the
interferometric data, the results of \vdw{} are presented in
continuum-free form as \(\Ttb(v) = \Tb(v) - \Tc\).  Combining
equation~\eqref{eq:Tcont} and \eqref{eq:Tline}, one finds
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Tb}
  \Ttb(v) =
  \bigl[ 1 - e^{-\tau(v)} \bigr] \,
  \bigl[ 1 - \bigl(\Tc''/\Te\bigr)\bigr] \,
  \bigl[  \Ts - \Tc' \bigr]  \ .
\end{equation}
The relative brightness temperature of the line, \(\Ttb(v)\), is
therefore seen to be the product of three factors, given by the three
sets of square brackets in equation~\eqref{eq:Tb}.  The first two
factors are always positive since \(\tau(v) \ge 0\) and
\(\Tc'' \le \Te\), but the third factor can take either sign.  When the
continuum brightness temperature \(\Tc'\) of the background
photoionized gas in region~1 exceeds the spin temperature \(\Ts\) of
neutral hydrogen in region~2, then we see an absorption line:
\(\Ttb(v) < 0\).  On the other hand, when \(\Ts\) is higher than
\(\Tc'\), then we see an emission line: \(\Ttb(v) > 0\).  In either
case, the maximum line strength will be found when region~2 is opaque
(\(\tau(v) \gg 1\)) and region~3 is transparent (\(\Tc'' \ll \Te\)), yielding
\(\max(|\Ttb(v)|) = |\Ts - \Tc'|\).

\newcommand\fbg{\ensuremath{f_{\mathrm{bg}}}}

The electron temperature in the ionized gas is expected to be roughly
constant at \(\Te \approx \SI{11 000}{K}\) \citep{Dicker:2009a}, but this
still leaves 4 unknown quantities, \(\tau(v)\), \(\Ts\), \(\Tc'\), and
\(\Tc''\), to be determined from 2 observed quantities: \(\Tc\) and
\(\Ttb(v)\).  Further assumptions must therefore be made in order to
interpret the observations, but these can be guided by the observed
spatial trends and simple geometric models.  For instance, in the
Orion Bar the free-free continuum brightness temperature falls sharply
across the ionization front from \(\Tc \approx \SI{3000}{K}\) on the ionized
side, but then levels off to a roughly constant value of
\(\Tc \approx \SI{600}{K}\) on the neutral side. Assuming that this constant
value reflects unrelated foreground emission (probably ionized by
\th2{A}) that overlays the entire Bar (this hypothesis is tested
below), we have an upper limit to the background emission of
\(\Tc - \SI{600}{K}\).  It can be further assumed that the emission
from region~1 is a constant fraction, \fbg{}, of this upper limit:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:bg-emission}
  \Tc' = \fbg \bigl( \Tc - \SI{600}{K} \bigr) \ .
\end{equation}
If the Bar geometry is a cylinder that is illuminated from the side
(see Fig.~XXX), then \(\fbg = 0.5\) is appropriate.  If the Bar is
illuminated from slightly behind, or if it is an escarpment, or if an
additional background component is present (see
\S~\ref{sec:structure-orion-bar}), then the fraction will be larger:
\(0.5 < \fbg < 1.0\).

Further progress can then be made by considering null points in the
nebula where line emission and absorption cancel out. At such points
\(\Ttb(v) \approx 0\), so that \(\Ts = \Tc'\) by equation~\eqref{eq:Tb}.
Absorption component~M is identified by \vdw{} as associated with
\chem{H^0} in the Bar, due to its velocity and spatial distribution.
Component~M consists of a string of knots with
\(\Ttb(v) = \text{\num{-200} to \SI{-400}{K}}\) at
\(v \approx \SI{11}{km.s^{-1}}\).  They are arranged parallel to the Bar,
just behind the ionization front at a relative position of roughly
\SI{+0.006}{pc} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-bar-profile}) and where the
continuum brightness has fallen to \(\Tc \approx \SI{2200}{K}\). At greater
distances from the ionization front the \ion{H}{1} at this velocity is
seen in emission, reaching a peak of \(\Ttb(v) \approx \SI{+250}{K}\) at
\SI{+0.030}{pc} where \(\Tc \approx \SI{750}{K}\).  The crossover null point
where \(\Ttb(v) = 0\) occurs between these two at \SI{+0.012}{pc}
where \(\Tc \approx \SI{1500}{K}\).
