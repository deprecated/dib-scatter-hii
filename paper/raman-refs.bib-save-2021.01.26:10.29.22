  abstract =      {We report here on the discovery of faint extended
                   wings of Hα observed out to an apparent velocity of
                   ̃7600 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> in the Orion Nebula (M42)
                   and in five H II regions in the Large and the Small
                   Magellanic Clouds. We show that these wings are
                   caused by Raman scattering of both the O I and Si II
                   resonance lines and stellar continuum UV photons with
                   H I followed by radiative decay to the H I n = 2
                   level. The broad wings also seen in Hβ and in Hγ
                   result from Raman scattering of the UV continuum in
                   the H I n = 4 and n = 5 levels, respectively. The
                   Raman scattering fluorescence is correlated with the
                   intensity of the narrow permitted lines of O I and Si
                   II. In the case of Si II, this is explained by
                   radiative pumping of the same 1023.7 Å resonance
                   line involved in the Raman scattering by the Lyβ
                   radiation field. The subsequent radiative cascade
                   produces enhanced Si II λλ5978.9, 6347.1, and
                   6371.4 Å permitted transitions. Finally, we show
                   that in O I, radiative pumping of the 1025.76 Å
                   resonance line by the Lyman series radiation field is
                   also the cause of the enhancement in the permitted
                   lines of this species lying near Hα in wavelength,
                   but here the process is a little more complex. We
                   argue that all these processes are active in the zone
                   of the H II region near the ionization front.},

                   in more than 50 percent of symbiotic stars. Up to now
                   these features have not been identified. They have

                   resonance doublet 1032, 1038 A by neutral hydrogen.

  abstract =      {Powered by a supermassive black hole with an
                   accretion disk, the spectra of active galactic nuclei
                   (AGNs) are characterized by prominent emission lines
                   including Balmer lines. The unification schemes of
                   AGNs require the existence of a thick molecular torus
                   that may hide the broad emission line region from the
                   view of observers near the equatorial direction. In
                   this configuration, one may expect that the far-UV
                   radiation from the central engine can be Raman
                   scattered by neutral hydrogen to reappear around
                   Balmer and Paschen emission lines, which can be
                   identified with broad wings. We produce Hα, Hβ, and
                   Paα wings using a Monte Carlo technique to
                   investigate their properties. The neutral scattering
                   region is assumed to be a cylindrical torus specified
                   by the inner and outer radii and the height. While
                   the covering factor of the scattering region affects
                   the overall strengths of the wings, the wing widths
                   are primarily dependent on the neutral hydrogen
                   column density N <SUB> H</SUB> I being roughly
                   proportional to N <SUB> H</SUB> I <SUP>1/2</SUP>. In
                   particular, with N <SUB> H</SUB> I = 10 <SUP>23</SUP>
                   cm <SUP>-2</SUP> the Hα wings typically show a width
                   ∼ 2× 10 <SUP>4</SUP> km s <SUP>-1</SUP>. We also
                   find that Hα and Paα wing profiles are asymmetric
                   with the red part stronger than the blue part and an
                   opposite behavior is seen for Hβ wings.},

                   molecular-line survey of the Orion A cloud, hereafter
                   referred to as the CARMA-NRO Orion Survey. CARMA
                   observations have been combined with single-dish data
                   from the Nobeyama 45 m telescope to provide extended
                   images at about 0.01 pc resolution, with a dynamic
                   range of approximately 1200 in spatial scale. Here we
                   describe the practical details of the data
                   combination in uv space, including flux scale
                   matching, the conversion of single-dish data to
                   visibilities, and joint deconvolution of single-dish
                   and interferometric data. A Delta-variance analysis
                   indicates that no artifacts are caused by combining
                   data from the two instruments. Initial analysis of
                   the data cubes, including moment maps, average
                   spectra, channel maps, position-velocity diagrams,
                   excitation temperature, column density, and line
                   ratio maps, provides evidence of complex and
                   interesting structures such as filaments, bipolar
                   outflows, shells, bubbles, and photo-eroded pillars.
                   The implications for star formation processes are
                   profound, and follow-up scientific studies by the

                   bands spanning 3-24 μm. The survey includes the

                   All Sky Survey point source catalog to generate a
                   catalog of eight-band photometry. We identify 3479
                   dusty young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Orion
                   molecular clouds by searching for point sources with
                   mid-IR colors indicative of reprocessed light from
                   dusty disks or infalling envelopes. The YSOs are
                   subsequently classified on the basis of their mid-IR
                   colors and their spatial distributions are presented.
                   We classify 2991 of the YSOs as pre-main-sequence
                   stars with disks and 488 as likely protostars. Most
                   of the sources were observed with IRAC in two to
                   three epochs over six months; we search for
                   variability between the epochs by looking for
                   correlated variability in the 3.6 and 4.5 μm bands.
                   We find that 50% of the dusty YSOs show variability.
                   The variations are typically small (~0.2 mag) with
                   the protostars showing a higher incidence of
                   variability and larger variations. The observed
                   correlations between the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 μm
                   variability suggests that we are observing variations

                   induced by stellar variability typical of
                   pre-main-sequence stars. We identify 2612 point-like

                   photometry. We define a spectrophotometric TiO index
                   that takes into account the fluxes in the V, I, and
                   TiO bands. Comparing it with spectral types of ONC
                   members in the literature, we find a correlation
                   between the index and the spectral type valid for
                   M-type stars, which is accurate to better than 1
                   spectral subclass for M3-M6 types and better than 2
                   spectral subclasses for M0-M2 types.. This allows us
                   to newly classify 217 stars. In a similar way, we
                   subtract from our Halpha photometry the photospheric
                   continuum at its wavelength, deriving calibrated line

                   of the central part of the Orion Nebula (M 42),
                   observed with the MUSE instrument at the ESO VLT. We
                   reduced the data with the public MUSE pipeline. The
                   output products are two FITS cubes with a spatial
                   size of ~5.´9×4.´9 (corresponding to ~0.76 × 0.63
                   pc2) and a contiguous wavelength coverage of
                   4595...9366 Å, spatially sampled at 0.´2. We
                   provide two versions with a sampling of 1.25 Å and
                   0.85 Å in dispersion direction. Together with
                   variance cubes these files have a size of 75 and 110
                   GiB on disk. They are the largest integral field
                   mosaics to date in terms of information content. We
                   make them available for use in the community. To
                   validate this dataset, we compare world coordinates,
                   reconstructed magnitudes, velocities, and absolute
                   and relative emission line fluxes to the literature
                   values and find excellent agreement. We derive a 2D
                   map of extinction and present de-reddened flux maps
                   of several individual emission lines and of
                   diagnostic line ratios. We estimate physical
                   properties of the Orion Nebula, using the emission
                   line ratios [N ii] and [S iii] (for the electron
                   temperature Te) and [S ii] and [Cl iii] (for the
                   electron density Ne), and show 2D images of the
                   velocity measured from several bright emission lines.

                   Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) in the

                   spanning 6 arcmin × 5 arcmin with a spatial
                   resolution of 0.2 arcsec. We use the S23(=([S II]
                   λλ6717, 6731+[S III] λ9068)/Hβ) parameter,
                   together with [O II]/[O III] as an indicator of the
                   degree of ionization, to distinguish between the
                   various small-scale structures. The only Orion bullet
                   covered by MUSE is HH 201, which shows a double
                   component in the [Fe II] λ8617 line throughout
                   indicating an expansion, and we discuss a scenario in
                   which this object is undergoing a disruptive event.
                   We separate the proplyds located south of the Bright
                   Bar into four categories depending on their S23
                   values, propose the utility of the S23 parameter as
                   an indicator of the shock contribution to the
                   excitation of line-emitting atoms, and show that the
                   MUSE data are able to identify the proplyds
                   associated with discs and microjets. We compute the
                   second-order structure function for the Hα, [O III]
                   λ5007, [S II] λ6731 and [O I] λ6300 emission lines
                   to analyse the turbulent velocity field of the region
                   covered with MUSE. We find that the spectral and
                   spatial resolution of MUSE are not able to faithfully

                   wavelength-dependent effect of the Earth's atmosphere
                   on the observed flux. <BR /> Methods: In order to
                   increase the accuracy of the exposure time calculator
                   of the European Southern Observatory's (ESO) Very
                   Large Telescope (VLT) at Cerro Paranal, an
                   atmospheric model was developed as part of the
                   Austrian ESO In-Kind contribution. It includes all
                   relevant components, such as scattered moonlight,
                   scattered starlight, zodiacal light, atmospheric
                   thermal radiation and absorption, and non-thermal
                   airglow emission. This paper focuses on atmospheric
                   scattering processes that mostly affect the blue
                   (&lt;0.55 μm) wavelength regime, and airglow
                   emission lines and continuum that dominate the red
                   (&gt;0.55 μm) wavelength regime. While the former is
                   mainly investigated by means of radiative transfer
                   models, the intensity and variability of the latter
                   is studied with a sample of 1186 VLT FORS 1 spectra.
                   <BR /> Results: For a set of parameters such as the
                   object altitude angle, Moon-object angular distance,
                   ecliptic latitude, bimonthly period, and solar radio
                   flux, our model predicts atmospheric radiation and

                   becoming more and more important for astrophysics
                   there is a marked lack of spectrophotometric standard
                   star data that would allow the flux calibration of
                   such data. Furthermore, flux calibrating medium- to
                   high-resolution échelle spectroscopy data is
                   challenging even in the optical wavelength range,
                   because the available flux standard data are often
                   too coarsely sampled. <BR /> Aims: We will provide
                   standard star reference data that allow users to
                   derive response curves from 300 nm to 2500 nm for
                   spectroscopic data of medium to high resolution,
                   including those taken with échelle spectrographs. In
                   addition we describe a method to correct for moderate
                   telluric absorption without the need of observing
                   telluric standard stars. <BR /> Methods: As reference
                   data for the flux standard stars we use theoretical
                   spectra derived from stellar model atmospheres. We
                   verify that they provide an appropriate description
                   of the observed standard star spectra by checking for
                   residuals in line cores and line overlap regions in
                   the ratios of observed (X-shooter) spectra to model
                   spectra. The finally selected model spectra are then
                   corrected for remaining mismatches and
                   photometrically calibrated using independent
                   observations. The correction of telluric absorption
                   is performed with the help of telluric model spectra.

                   reference spectra without telluric absorption for six
                   southern flux standard stars that allow the users to
                   flux calibrate their data from 300 nm to 2500 nm, and

  abstract =      {The optical appearance of the Orion Nebula is
                   significantly altered by the presence of interstellar
                   extinction. Since Orion is high above the Galactic
                   plane and is nearby, most of this extinction is due
                   to material immediately in front of the associated
                   star cluster. This extinction fundamentally alters
                   the optical appearance of the Orion Nebula. We have
                   quantitatively determined the extinction correction
                   by comparing the surface brightness of the nebula at
                   a resolution of about 1.7" in the radio continuum and
                   the Halpha emission line. The results compare well
                   with new determinations made from Halpha and Hbeta
                   line ratios. Extinction-corrected optical images are
                   generated and discussed. The most important
                   extinction feature, the dark bay that obscures the
                   east side of the nebula, has a mass of about 3 Msolar
                   and possesses numerous small knots of material in
                   addition to a feature that appears to be a shock. We
                   also find that the thin main emitting layer on the
                   front of the parent Orion molecular cloud is marked
                   by numerous walls and plateaus. Only one such
                   structure had been previously known, the one that
                   produces a bright bar across the southeast portion of
                   the nebula. The sharpest structure is associated with
                   the complex of molecular outflow and infrared sources
                   near the region called Orion-S and is likely to be
                   the result of uncollimated outflow from an imbedded
                   young star. Based in part on observations with the
                   Very Large Array of the National Radio Astronomy

                   Science Foundation, operated under cooperative

                   The rotational velocities were obtained using the
                   Fourier analysis method, and we found agreement with
                   values derived by the usual method based on linewidth
                   measurements. The rotational velocity derived for
                   theta1 Ori C by this method is consistent with the
                   variability of some of its spectral features that
                   have a period of 15.42 days. By means of the fit of
                   H, He I, and He II observed profiles with Fastwind
                   synthetic profiles, stellar parameters and wind
                   characteristics were derived. This methodology let us
                   estimate the errors associated with these parameters,
                   and we found that macroturbulence effects have to be
                   included for a good fit to the He I-II lines in the
                   spectrum of theta1 Ori C. By means of a very accurate
                   study, oxygen abundances were derived for the three
                   B0.5V stars theta1 Ori A, D, and theta2 Ori B. Final
                   abundances are consistent with the nebular gas-phase
                   results presented in Esteban et al. (2004) and are
                   lower than those given by Cunha & Lambert (1994). Our
                   results suggest a lower dust depletion factor of
                   oxygen than previous estimations for the Orion

  abstract =      {Context. Airglow emission lines, which dominate the
                   optical-to-near-infrared sky radiation, show strong,
                   line-dependent variability on time scales from
                   minutes to decades. Therefore, the subtraction of the
                   sky background in the affected wavelength regime
                   becomes a problem if plain-sky spectra have to be
                   taken at a different time from the astronomical data.
                   <BR /> Aims: A solution of this problem is the
                   physically motivated scaling of the airglow lines in
                   the plain-sky data to fit the sky lines in the object
                   spectrum. We have developed a corresponding
                   instrument-independent approach based on
                   one-dimensional spectra. <BR /> Methods: Our code
                   skycorr separates sky lines and sky/object continuum
                   by an iterative approach involving a line finder and
                   airglow line data. The sky lines, which mainly belong
                   to OH and O<SUB>2</SUB> bands, are grouped according
                   to their expected variability. The line groups in the
                   sky data are then scaled to fit the sky in the
                   science data. Required pixel-specific weights for
                   overlapping groups are taken from a comprehensive
                   airglow model. Deviations in the wavelength
                   calibration are corrected for by fitting Chebyshev
                   polynomials and rebinning via asymmetric damped sinc
                   kernels. The scaled sky lines and the sky continuum
                   are subtracted separately. <BR /> Results: ESO-VLT
                   X-shooter data covering 2.5 h with a good time
                   resolution were selected to illustrate the
                   performance. Data taken six nights and about one year
                   before were also used as reference sky data. The
                   variation of the sky-subtraction quality as a
                   function of time difference between the object and
                   sky data depends on changes in the airglow intensity,
                   atmospheric transparency, and instrument calibration.
                   Except for short time intervals of a few minutes, the
                   sky line residuals were between 2.1 and 5.5 times
                   weaker than for sky subtraction without fitting.
                   Additional tests showed that skycorr performs
                   consistently better than the method of Davies (2007,
                   MNRAS, 375, 1099) developed for ESO-VLT SINFONI

  abstract =      {Context. The interaction of the light from
                   astronomical objects with the constituents of the
                   Earth's atmosphere leads to the formation of telluric
                   absorption lines in ground-based collected spectra.
                   Correcting for these lines, mostly affecting the red
                   and infrared region of the spectrum, usually relies
                   on observations of specific stars obtained close in
                   time and airmass to the science targets, therefore
                   using precious observing time. <BR /> Aims: We
                   present molecfit, a tool to correct for telluric
                   absorption lines based on synthetic modelling of the
                   Earth's atmospheric transmission. Molecfit is
                   versatile and can be used with data obtained with
                   various ground-based telescopes and instruments. <BR
                   /> Methods: Molecfit combines a publicly available
                   radiative transfer code, a molecular line database,
                   atmospheric profiles, and various kernels to model
                   the instrument line spread function. The atmospheric
                   profiles are created by merging a standard
                   atmospheric profile representative of a given
                   observatory's climate, of local meteorological data,
                   and of dynamically retrieved altitude profiles for
                   temperature, pressure, and humidity. We discuss the
                   various ingredients of the method, its applicability,
                   and its limitations. We also show examples of
                   telluric line correction on spectra obtained with a
                   suite of ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) instruments.
                   <BR /> Results: Compared to previous similar tools,
                   molecfit takes the best results for temperature,
                   pressure, and humidity in the atmosphere above the
                   observatory into account. As a result, the standard
                   deviation of the residuals after correction of
                   unsaturated telluric lines is frequently better than
                   2% of the continuum. <BR /> Conclusions: Molecfit is
                   able to accurately model and correct for telluric
                   lines over a broad range of wavelengths and spectral
                   resolutions. The accuracy reached is comparable to or
                   better than the typical accuracy achieved using a
                   telluric standard star observation. The availability
                   of such a general tool for telluric absorption
                   correction may improve future observational and
                   analysing strategies, as well as empower users of

                   allow us to construct an isovelocity data cube and

                   and propose that these constitute a new class of
                   strigiform (owl-like) nebulae. Common characteristics
                   of the strigiform nebulae include a double-shell

                   cavities, visible in both optical and mid-infrared
                   emission lines, that show no evidence for surrounding
                   bright rims. The origin of the cavities is unclear,
                   but they may constitute relics of an earlier stage of

                   the heating from the photo-electric effect acting on
                   dust grains, and the cooling via the copious emission
                   of photons in far-infrared lines. The Orion Bar is a
                   luminous and nearby PDR, which presents to the
                   observer an ideal edge-on orientation in which to
                   study this energy balance. Spatially resolved studies
                   of such a nearby system are essential as they enable
                   us to characterise the physical processes that
                   control the energetics of the regions and can serve
                   as templates for distant systems where these
                   processes cannot be disentangled. Aims: We
                   characterise the emission of the far-infrared
                   fine-structure lines of [C ii] (158 mum), [O i] (63
                   and 145 mum), and [N ii] (122 mum) that trace the gas
                   local conditions, via spatially resolved observations
                   of the Orion Bar. The observed distribution and
                   variation of the lines are discussed in relation to
                   the underlying geometry and linked to the energetics
                   associated with the Trapezium stars.
                   Methods.Herschel/PACS observations are used to map
                   the spatial distribution of these fine-structure
                   lines across the Bar, with a spatial resolution
                   between 4'' and 11'' and covering a total square area
                   of about 120'' × 105''. The spatial profile of the
                   emission lines are modelled using the radiative
                   transfer code Cloudy. Results: The Herschel
                   observations reveal in unprecedented detail the
                   morphology of the Bar. The spatial distribution of
                   the [C ii] line coincides with that of the [O i]
                   lines. The [N ii] line peaks closer to the ionising
                   star than the other three lines, but with a small
                   region of overlap. We can distinguish several knots
                   of enhanced emission within the Bar indicating the
                   presence of an inhomogenous and structured medium.
                   The emission profiles cannot be reproduced by a
                   single PDR, clearly indicating that, besides the Bar,
                   there is a significant contribution from additional
                   PDR(s) over the area studied. The combination of both
                   the [N ii] and [O i] 145 mum lines can be used to
                   estimate the [C ii] emission and distinguish between
                   its ionised or neutral origin. We have calculated how
                   much [C ii] emission comes from the neutral and
                   ionised region, and find that at least ~82%
                   originates from the photo-dissocciation region.
                   Together, the [C ii] 158 mum and [O i] 63 and 145 mum
                   lines account for ~90% of the power emitted by the
                   main cooling lines in the Bar (including CO, H2,
                   etc.), with [O i] 63 mum alone accounting for 72% of
                   the total.},

  abstract =      {Context. With Herschel, we can for the first time
                   observe a wealth of high-J CO lines in the
                   interstellar medium with a high angular resolution.
                   These lines are specifically useful for tracing the
                   warm and dense gas and are therefore very appropriate
                   for a study of strongly irradiated dense
                   photodissocation regions (PDRs). <BR /> Aims: We
                   characterize the morphology of CO J = 19-18 emission
                   and study the high-J CO excitation in a highly
                   UV-irradiated prototypical PDR, the Orion Bar. <BR />
                   Methods: We used fully sampled maps of CO J = 19-18
                   emission with the Photoconductor Array Camera and
                   Spectrometer (PACS) on board the Herschel Space
                   Observatory over an area of 110'' × 110'' with an
                   angular resolution of 9''. We studied the morphology
                   of this high-J CO line in the Orion Bar and in the
                   region in front and behind the Bar, and compared it
                   with lower-J lines of CO from J = 5-4 to J = 13-12
                   and <SUP>13</SUP>CO from J = 5-4 to J = 11-10
                   emission observed with the Herschel Spectral and
                   Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE). In addition, we
                   compared the high-J CO to polycyclic aromatic
                   hydrocarbon (PAH) emission and vibrationally excited
                   H<SUB>2</SUB>. We used the CO and <SUP>13</SUP>CO
                   observations and the RADEX model to derive the
                   physical conditions in the warm molecular gas layers.
                   <BR /> Results: The CO J = 19-18 line is detected
                   unambiguously everywhere in the observed region, in
                   the Bar, and in front and behind of it. In the Bar,
                   the most striking features are several knots of
                   enhanced emission that probably result from column
                   and/or volume density enhancements. The corresponding
                   structures are most likely even smaller than what
                   PACS is able to resolve. The high-J CO line mostly
                   arises from the warm edge of the Orion Bar PDR, while
                   the lower-J lines arise from a colder region farther
                   inside the molecular cloud. Even if it is slightly
                   shifted farther into the PDR, the high-J CO emission
                   peaks are very close to the H/H<SUB>2</SUB>
                   dissociation front, as traced by the peaks of
                   H<SUB>2</SUB> vibrational emission. Our results also
                   suggest that the high-J CO emitting gas is mainly
                   excited by photoelectric heating. The CO J = 19-18/J
                   = 12-11 line intensity ratio peaks in front of the CO
                   J = 19-18 emission between the dissociation and
                   ionization fronts, where the PAH emission also peak.
                   A warm or hot molecular gas could thus be present in
                   the atomic region where the intense UV radiation is
                   mostly unshielded. In agreement with recent ALMA
                   detections, low column densities of hot molecular gas
                   seem to exist between the ionization and dissociation
                   fronts. As found in other studies, the best fit with
                   RADEX modeling for beam-averaged physical conditions
                   is for a density of 10<SUP>6</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>
                   and a high thermal pressure (P/k = n<SUB>H</SUB> ×
                   T) of 1-2 × 10<SUP>8</SUP> K cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. <BR />
                   Conclusions: The high-J CO emission is concentrated
                   close to the dissociation front in the Orion Bar. Hot
                   CO may also lie in the atomic PDR between the
                   ionization and dissociation fronts, which is
                   consistent with the dynamical and photoevaporation
                   effects. Herschel is an ESA space observatory with

                   rotational lines, at angular resolutions of 8 to 17".
                   Combined with existing data, our images provide a
                   detailed view of the stratification of abundances and
                   excitation conditions in the edge-on photon-dominated
                   region in the Orion bar. A thin (=~0.022pc ) layer of
                   atomic hydrogen is located adjacent to the ionization
                   front. The transition to H_2_ occurs 15" from the
                   ionization front and is marked by a maximum in the
                   H_2_ v=1-0 S(1) emission. CO is formed 20" from the
                   ionization front, and a peak in CS emission occurs
                   slightly deeper inside the cloud. HCO^+^ J=1-0
                   emission is brightest close to the H_2_ v=1-0 S(1)
                   peak near the illuminated surface. We argue that the
                   HCO^+^ is produced by photo-driven reactions in hot
                   gas. Our images show that the neutral clouds near the
                   bar are very clumpy, containing structure down to the
                   resolution limit of the observations. The presence of
                   an interclump medium is indicated by the detection of
                   a pervasive purely fluorescent component to the H_2_
                   emission. The density of hydrogen nuclei in the
                   interclump medium is approximately 10^4^cm^-3^ ,
                   while the CO and CS data indicate densities that are
                   at least a factor of 20 higher. The implications of
                   our results for physical models of the structure and
                   geometry of the Orion bar are discussed.},

                   efficiently form very close to the H/H<SUB>2</SUB>
                   transition zone, at a depth of A<SUB>V</SUB> ≲ 1
                   mag into the neutral cloud, where abundant
                   C<SUP>+</SUP>, S<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>*</SUP> coexist.
                   SO<SUP>+</SUP> peaks slightly deeper into the cloud.
                   The observed ions have low rotational temperatures
                   (T<SUB>rot</SUB> ≈ 10-30 K ≪ T<SUB>k</SUB>) and
                   narrow line-widths ( 2-3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), a factor
                   of ≃2 narrower that those of the lighter reactive
                   ion CH<SUP>+</SUP>. This is consistent with the
                   higher reactivity and faster radiative pumping rates
                   of CH<SUP>+</SUP> compared to the heavier ions, which
                   are driven relatively more quickly toward smaller
                   velocity dispersion by elastic collisions and toward
                   lower T<SUB>rot</SUB> by inelastic collisions. We
                   estimate column densities and average physical
                   conditions from an excitation model (n(H<SUB>2</SUB>)
                   ≈ 10<SUP>5</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>,
                   n(e<SUP>-</SUP>) ≈ 10 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, and
                   T<SUB>k</SUB> ≈ 200 K). Regardless of the
                   excitation details, SH<SUP>+</SUP> and
                   HOC<SUP>+</SUP> clearly trace the most exposed layers
                   of the UV-irradiated molecular cloud surface, whereas
                   SO<SUP>+</SUP> arises from slightly more shielded

  abstract =      {We have obtained NIR spectral line maps of a limited
                   region around the Orion Bar ionization front using
                   the red and blue grisms of SOFI on the ESO NTT
                   telescope. The wavelength range covered was from 0.95
                   to 2.3 mum. In addition to many well studied
                   features, we detected two lines at 1.07 and 1.17 {mum
                   } due to recombination to CI which have excitations
                   above 60000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. We also observe several
                   features at around 1 micron of atomic nitrogen (at
                   still higher excitations) which we believe are caused
                   by fluorescence of UV lines at approximately 955
                   &#197; in gas within the ionization front. We give a
                   brief analysis of this process showing that one can
                   infer the relative UV intensities incident upon the
                   ionization front on the basis of the NIR spectra.
                   Analogously, the spatial distribution of the
                   fluorescent OI 1.317 {mum } line allows one to infer
                   the geometry of the ionization front. We consider
                   various geometries and conclude that the Orion Bar is
                   most likely to be a cylinder or filament in the plane
                   of the sky. Maps in the 9840 &#197; CI line were also
                   obtained and compared with the corresponding
                   intensity distribution in C91alpha from Wyrowski et
                   al. (1997). These are emitted from the same general
                   area but show differences in detail which are likely
                   partly to be due to patchy extinction. The CI NIR
                   line correlates well with molecular hydrogen emission
                   away from the high density high radiation field
                   layers of the Bar. The measured CI line ratios (in
                   particular the ratio of the 0.984 and 1.07 {mum }
                   lines) suggest higher temperatures in the
                   C<SUP>+</SUP> layer than allowed from the measured
                   radio line width. The explanation for this
                   discrepancy is not clear but it points up the need
                   for observations in the NIR with higher spectral
                   resolution and in the radio with higher spatial
                   resolution. Based on observations obtained at the
                   European Southern Observatory, Chile},

                   H, and K wavelength bands towards two positions along
                   the Orion bar. These data have been supplemented with
                   images made using the ARNICA camera mounted on TIRGO
                   as well as with an ESO NTT observation carried out by
                   Dr A. Moorwood. We detect a variety of transitions of
                   hydrogen, helium, OI, FeII, FeIII, and H_2. From our
                   molecular hydrogen data, we conclude that densities
                   are moderate (3-6x 10(4) cm(-3) ) in the layer
                   responsible for the molecular hydrogen emission and
                   give no evidence for the presence of dense neutral
                   clumps. We also find that the molecular hydrogen bar
                   is likely to be tilted by ~ 10 degrees relative to
                   the line of sight. We discuss the relative merits of
                   several models of the structure of the bar and
                   conclude that it may be split into two structures
                   separated by 0.2-0.3 parsec along the line of sight.
                   It also seems likely to us that in both structures,
                   density increases along a line perpendicular to the
                   ionization front which penetrates into the neutral
                   gas. We have used the 1.317mum OI line to estimate
                   the FUV radiation field incident at the ionization
                   front and find values of 1-3x 10(4) greater than the
                   average interstellar field. From [FeII] line
                   measurements, we conclude that the electron density
                   in the ionized layer associated with the ionization
                   front is of order 10(4) \percc. Finally, our analysis
                   of the helium and hydrogen recombination lines
                   implies essential coincidence of the helium and
                   hydrogen Stromgren spheres.},

                   extinction and the IR emission is proposed which uses
                   an empirical dust model made of big grains, very
                   small grains, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
                   It is argued that the big grain component is probably
                   made of a size distribution of silicates with some
                   dark refractory mantle and that very small gains are
                   probably carbon-dominated. The variations of IR
                   colors with the intensity of the incident radiation
                   field is studied in various astrophysical situations.
                   Correlations between anomalous extinction curves and
                   anomalous IR colors are predicted.},

                   understanding of the interstellar medium and star
                   formation. The manner in which dust populations
                   evolve with the excitation and the physical
                   conditions is a first step in comprehending the
                   evolution of interstellar dust. <BR /> Aims: Within
                   the framework of the Evolution of interstellar dust
                   Herschel key programme, we have acquired PACS and
                   SPIRE spectrophotometric observations of various
                   photodissociation regions, to characterise this
                   evolution. The aim of this paper is to trace the
                   evolution of dust grains in the Orion Bar
                   photodissociation region. <BR /> Methods: We used
                   Herschel/PACS (70 and 160 μm) and SPIRE (250, 350
                   and 500 μm) together with Spitzer/IRAC observations
                   to map the spatial distribution of the dust
                   populations across the Bar. Brightness profiles were
                   modelled using the DustEM model coupled with a
                   radiative transfer code. <BR /> Results: Thanks to
                   Herschel, we are able to probe in great detail the
                   dust emission of the densest parts of the Orion Bar
                   with a resolution from 5.6″ to 35.1″. These new
                   observations allow us to infer the temperature of the
                   biggest grains at different positions in the Bar,
                   which reveals a gradient from ~70 K to 35 K coupled
                   with an increase of the spectral emissivity index
                   from the ionization front to the densest regions.
                   Combining Spitzer/IRAC observations, which are
                   sensitive to the dust emission from the surface, with
                   Herschel maps, we were able to measure the Orion Bar
                   emission from 3.6 to 500 μm. We find a
                   stratification in the different dust components that
                   can be quantitatively reproduced by a simple
                   radiative transfer model without dust evolution
                   (diffuse interstellar medium abundances and optical
                   properties). However, including dust evolution is
                   needed to explain the brightness in each band.
                   Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) abundance
                   variations, or a combination of PAH abundance
                   variations with an enhancement of the biggest grain
                   emissivity caused by coagulation give good results.
                   Another hypothesis is to consider a length of the Bar
                   along the line of sight different at the ionization
                   front than in the densest parts. Herschel is an ESA

                   developing a robust extinction correction covering
                   our optical and UV FOS and STIS observations, we
                   examined the decrement within various series of He I
                   lines. The decrements of the 23S-n3P, 23P-n3S, and
                   33S-n3P series are not in accord with case B
                   recombination theory. None of these anomalous He I
                   decrements can be explained by extinction, indicating
                   the presence of additional radiative transfer effects
                   in He I lines ranging from the near-IR to the
                   near-UV. CLOUDY photoionization equilibrium models
                   including radiative transfer are developed to predict
                   the observed He I decrements, and the quantitative
                   agreement is quite remarkable. Following from these
                   results, select He I lines are combined with H I and
                   [O II] lines and stellar extinction data to validate
                   a new normalizable analytic expression for the
                   wavelength dependence of the extinction. In so doing,
                   the He+/H+ abundance is also derived. Based in part

                   galaxies. Among massive stars, those of O type play a

                   designed to collect information and study O-type

                   for objects with previous spectroscopic and/or
                   eclipsing binary orbits. In future papers we will

                   Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS), a project that obtains
                   blue-violet R ∼ 2500 spectroscopy of thousands of
                   massive stars, and LiLiMaRlin, a library of libraries
                   of high-resolution spectroscopy of massive stars
                   obtained from four different surveys (CAFÉ-BEANS,

                   own observing programs and public archives. We have
                   also used lucky images obtained with AstraLux. <BR />

                   classifications for 92 O-type spectroscopic multiple
                   systems and ten optical companions, many of them
                   original. We discuss the visual multiplicity of each
                   system with the support of AstraLux images and
                   additional sources. For eleven O-type objects and for
                   six B-type objects we present their first GOSSS
                   spectral classifications. For two known eclipsing
                   binaries we detect double absorption lines (SB2) or a
                   single moving line (SB1) for the first time, to which
                   we add a third system reported by us recently. For
                   two previous SB1 systems we detect their SB2 nature
                   for the first time and give their first separate
                   spectral classifications, something we have also done
                   for a third object just recently identified as a SB2.
                   We also detect nine new astrometric companions and
                   provide updated information on several others. We
                   emphasize the results for two stars: for σ Ori AaAbB
                   we provide spectral classifications for the three
                   components with a single observation for the first
                   time thanks to a lucky spectroscopy observation
                   obtained close to the Aa,Ab periastron and for
                   θ<SUP>1</SUP> Ori CaCb we add it to the class of
                   Galactic Of?p stars, raising the number of its
                   members to six. Our sample of O-type spectroscopic
                   binaries contains more triple- or higher-order
                   systems than double systems. <P />Table A.2 is also

                   presumably fossil origin at the surface of the very
                   young O star theta1 Ori C. The Stokes V signatures we
                   detect are variable with time, the variations being
                   consistent with rotational modulation. A detailed
                   modelling of our observations indicates that this
                   dipole field has an intensity of 1.1+/-0.1kG and is
                   inclined at 42$\,^{\circ}$+/-6$\,^{\circ}$ with
                   respect to the rotation axis (assumed to be inclined
                   at 45$\,^{\circ}$ to the line of sight). We find, in
                   particular, that the positive magnetic pole comes
                   closest to the observer when the variable Halpha
                   emission component observed on this star reaches
                   maximum strength. This discovery represents the first
                   definite detection of a magnetic field in an O star,
                   as well as the first detection of a fossil field in a

                   the magnetic confinement of the radiatively driven

                   Montmerle. In the case of theta1 Ori C, this model
                   predicts the formation of a large magnetosphere
                   (extending as far as 2-3R*), consisting of a very hot

                   by the strong collision of the wind streams from both
                   stellar magnetic hemispheres, as well as a dense
                   cooling disc forming in the magnetospheric equator.
                   We find that this model includes most of the physics
                   required to obtain a satisfactory level of agreement
                   with the extensive data sets available for theta1 Ori
                   C in the literature (and, in particular, with the
                   recent X-ray data and the phase-resolved
                   spectroscopic observations of ultraviolet and optical
                   wind lines) provided that the mass-loss rate of
                   theta1 Ori C is at least 5 times smaller than that
                   predicted by radiatively driven wind models. We
                   finally show how new observations with the XMM or
                   Chandra spacecraft could help us constrain this model
                   much more tightly and thus obtain a clear picture of
                   how magnetic fields can influence the winds of hot
                   stars.},

                   confinement of a radiatively driven, massive-star
                   wind. The specific parameters are chosen to represent
                   the prototypical slowly rotating magnetic O star
                   theta1 Ori C, for which centrifugal and other
                   dynamical effects of rotation are negligible. The
                   computed global structure in latitude and radius
                   resembles that found in previous 2D simulations, with
                   unimpeded outflow along open field lines near the
                   magnetic poles, and a complex equatorial belt of
                   inner wind trapping by closed loops near the stellar
                   surface, giving way to outflow above the Alfvén
                   radius. In contrast to this previous 2D work, the 3D
                   simulation described here now also shows how this
                   complex structure fragments in azimuth, forming
                   distinct clumps of closed loop infall within the
                   Alfvén radius, transitioning in the outer wind to
                   radial spokes of enhanced density with characteristic
                   azimuthal separation of
                   15$\,^{\circ}$-20$\,^{\circ}$. Applying these results
                   in a 3D code for line radiative transfer, we show
                   that emission from the associated 3D `dynamical
                   magnetosphere' matches well the observed Halpha
                   emission seen from theta1 Ori C, fitting both its
                   dynamic spectrum over rotational phase and the
                   observed level of cycle-to-cycle stochastic
                   variation. Comparison with previously developed 2D
                   models for the Balmer emission from a dynamical
                   magnetosphere generally confirms that time averaging
                   over 2D snapshots can be a good proxy for the spatial
                   averaging over 3D azimuthal wind structure.
                   Nevertheless, fully 3D simulations will still be
                   needed to model the emission from magnetospheres with
                   non-dipole field components, such as suggested by
                   asymmetric features seen in the Halpha
                   equivalent-width curve of theta1 Ori C.},

                   arcmin, with a diffraction-limited spatial resolution
                   of 0.35" it includes the BN/KL region, the Trapezium,
                   and OMC-1 South. Excluding BN/KL, we detect 91
                   thermal-IR point sources, with 27 known proplyds and
                   over 30 ``naked'' stars showing no extended structure
                   in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. Within the
                   region we surveyed, ~80% of known proplyds show
                   detectable thermal-IR emission, almost 40% of naked
                   stars are detected at 11.7 mum, and the fraction of
                   all visible sources with 11.7 mum excess emission
                   (including both proplyds and stars with unresolved
                   disks) is roughly 50%. These fractions exclude
                   embedded sources. Thermal dust emission from stars
                   exhibiting no extended structure in HST images is
                   surprising and means that they have retained
                   circumstellar dust disks comparable to the size of
                   our solar system. Proplyds and stars with IR excess
                   are not distributed randomly in the nebula; instead,
                   they show a clear anticorrelation in their spatial
                   distribution, with proplyds clustered close to theta1
                   Ori C and other IR sources found preferentially
                   farther away. We suspect that the clustered proplyds
                   trace the youngest ~0.5 Myr age group associated with
                   the Trapezium, while the more uniformly distributed
                   sources trace the older 1-2 Myr population of the
                   Orion Nebula Cluster. This suggests that small
                   protoplanetary disks persist for a few million years
                   in irradiated environments and hints that
                   hierarchical subclustering has been important on ~30"
                   scales around the Trapezium. We detect 11.7 mum
                   emission from the five brightest members of the
                   Trapezium (theta1 Ori A, B, C, D, and E), caused by
                   free-free stellar wind emission and possibly emission
                   from dusty disks around companion stars. Within 30"
                   of theta1 Ori C, 100% of known proplyds are detected
                   at 11.7 mum, and they exhibit remarkable
                   limb-brightened dust arcs at the collision of the
                   proplyd mass loss and the wind from theta1 Ori C. The
                   star theta1 Ori D is associated with the most
                   prominent mid-IR dust arc of the Ney-Allen Nebula. We
                   propose that this arc is the consequence of theta1
                   Ori D being the closest member of the Trapezium to
                   the background cloud. Finally, we detect dust
                   emission from Herbig-Haro jets in Orion, including HH
                   202, 529, 513, and 514. This is the first detection
                   of mid-IR continuum emission from dust in the body of
                   a collimated HH jet or bow shock. The presence of
                   dust implies that some jet material must be lifted
                   from large radii in the accretion disk (outside the
                   dust sublimation radius) or entrained from the
                   circumstellar environment. Based on observations

                   conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) along the
                   sightline toward the observed stars. A small survey
                   was made in optical wavelengths, producing
                   high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra. We
                   present measurements of 19 DIBs' properties in 50
                   sightlines toward hot stars, distributed at a variety
                   of galactic coordinates and interstellar reddening.
                   Equivalent widths were obtained by fitting asymmetric
                   Gaussian and variable continua to DIBs. Conditions of
                   the ISM were calculated from eight atomic and
                   molecular interstellar lines. Two distinctly
                   different types of DIBs were identified by carefully
                   comparing correlation coefficients between DIBs and
                   reddening and by different behavior in UV-shielded
                   (ζ) and nonshielded (σ) sightlines. A ratio of DIBs
                   at 5780 Å and 5797 Å proved to be reliable enough
                   to distinguish between two different sightline types.
                   Based on the linear relations between DIB equivalent
                   width and reddening for σ and ζ sightlines, we
                   divide DIBs into type I (where both linear relations
                   are similar) and type II (where they are
                   significantly different). The linear relation for ζ
                   type sightlines always shows a higher slope and
                   larger x-intercept parameter than the relation for σ
                   sightlines. Scatter around the linear relation is
                   reduced after the separation, but it does not vanish
                   completely. This means that UV shielding is the
                   dominant factor of the DIB equivalent width versus
                   reddening relation shape for ζ sightlines, but in σ
                   sightlines other physical parameters play a major
                   role. No similar dependency on gas density, electron
                   density, or turbulence was observed. A catalog of all
                   observed interstellar lines is made public.},

                   data provide us with an unprecedented sampling of the
                   skies at high Galactic latitude and low dust column
                   density. We present our method, study the correlation

                   As previously found, DIBs strengths correlate with

                   However, we show that DIBs can exist even in

                   correlation with dust varies significantly over the

                   expectation from dust, are often spread over hundreds
                   of square degrees. These patches are different for
                   the four DIBs, showing that they are unlikely to
                   originate from the same carrier, as previously

                   of which are in regions of high radiation fields, as

                   useful in deriving interstellar parameters when
                   direct methods are not available. For instance, with
                   care, the value of N(H) can be derived from W

  abstract =      {Echelle spectra of the double-lined spectroscopic
                   binary HD 204827 were obtained on five nights, at a
                   resolving power R = 38,000 and with a S/N = 750 near
                   6000 Å in the final, combined spectrum. The stars
                   show E(B - V) = 1.11 and spectral types near O9.5 V
                   and B0.5 III. A catalog is presented of 380 diffuse
                   interstellar bands (DIBs) measured between 3900 and
                   8100 Å in the stars' spectrum. The central
                   wavelengths, the widths (FWHM), and the equivalent
                   widths of nearly all of the bands are tabulated,
                   along with the minimum uncertainties in the latter.
                   The reliable removal of very weak stellar lines from
                   the catalog, and of some stellar lines from the less
                   severe blends with DIBs, is made generally easy by
                   the highly variable radial velocities of both stars.
                   The principal result of this investigation is that
                   the great majority of the bands in the catalog are
                   very weak and relatively narrow. Typical equivalent
                   widths amount to a few mÅ, and the bandwidths (FWHM)
                   are most often near 0.55 Å. Therefore, most of these
                   DIBs can be detected only in spectra obtained at a
                   resolving power and a S/N at least comparable to
                   those used here. In addition, the anomalous
                   interstellar reddening and the very high value of the
                   ratio N(C<SUB>2</SUB>)/E(B - V) seen toward HD 204827
                   indicate that the physical conditions in one or more
                   of the several interstellar clouds seen in this
                   direction differ significantly from those found
                   toward the prototypical DIB target HD 183143, for
                   example. Probably primarily for these reasons, 113 of
                   the 380 bands (30%) were not detected in four
                   previous modern surveys of the DIBs seen in the
                   spectra of stars other than HD 204827. No preferred
                   wavenumber spacings among the 380 bands are reliably
                   identified which could provide clues to the
                   identities of the large molecules thought to cause
                   the DIBs.},

                   interstellar bands (DIBs) remains to be established,
                   with the exception of five bands attributed to
                   C<SUB>60</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>, although it is generally
                   agreed that DIB carriers should be large carbon-based
                   molecules (with ~10-100 atoms) in the gas phase, such
                   as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), long
                   carbon chains or fullerenes. The aim of this paper is
                   to investigate more specific possible carriers among
                   PAHs, namely elongated molecules, which could explain
                   a correlation between the DIB wavelength and the
                   apparent UV resilience of their carriers. More
                   specifically, we address the case of polyacenes,
                   C<SUB>4N+2</SUB>H<SUB>2N+4</SUB>, with N ~ 10-18
                   fused rectilinear aligned hexagons. Polyacenes are
                   attractive DIB carrier candidates because their high
                   symmetry and large linear size allow them to form
                   regular series of bands in the visible range with
                   strengths larger than most other PAHs, as confirmed
                   by recent laboratory results up to undecacene
                   (C<SUB>46</SUB>H<SUB>26</SUB>). Those with very
                   strong bands in the DIB spectral domain are just at
                   the limit of stability against UV photodissociation.
                   They are part of the prominent PAH family of
                   interstellar carbon compounds, meaning that only
                   ~10<SUP>-5</SUP> of the total PAH abundance is enough
                   to account for a medium-strength DIB. After
                   summarizing the limited current knowledge about the
                   complex properties of polyacenes and recent
                   laboratory results, the likelihood that they might
                   meet the criteria for being carriers of some DIBs is
                   addressed by reviewing the following properties:
                   wavelength and strength of their series of visible
                   bands; interstellar stability and abundances, charge
                   state and hydrogenation; and DIB rotation profiles.
                   No definite inconsistency has been identified that
                   precludes polyacenes from being the carriers of some
                   DIBs with medium or weak strength, including the
                   so-called C<SUB>2</SUB> DIBs. But, despite their many
                   interesting properties, additional experimental data
                   about long acenes and their visible bands are needed
                   to make robust conclusions.},

                   ionization front and the dissociation front of the
                   nebula IC 63. This photodissociation region (PDR)
                   exhibits intense extended red emission (ERE)
                   attributed to fluorescence by large molecules/ions.
                   We detected strong diffuse interstellar bands (DIB)
                   in the stellar spectrum, including an exceptionally
                   strong and broad DIB at λ4428. The detection of
                   strong DIBs in association with ERE could be
                   consistent with the suggestion that the carriers of
                   DIBs and ERE are identical. The likely ERE process is
                   recurrent fluorescence, enabled by inverse internal
                   conversions from highly excited vibrational levels of
                   the ground state to low-lying electronic states with
                   subsequent transitions to ground. This provides a
                   path to rapid radiative cooling for
                   molecules/molecular ions, greatly enhancing their
                   ability to survive in a strongly irradiated
                   environment. The ratio of the equivalent widths (EWs)
                   of DIBs λ5797 and λ5780 in IC 63 is the same as
                   that observed in the low-density interstellar medium
                   with ultraviolet (UV) interstellar radiation fields
                   (ISRF) weaker by at least two orders of magnitude.
                   This falsifies suggestions that the ratio of these
                   two DIBs can serve as a measure of the UV strength of
                   the ISRF. Observations of the nebular spectrum of the
                   PDR of IC 63 at locations immediately adjacent to
                   where DIBs were detected failed to reveal any
                   presence of sharp emission features seen in the
                   spectrum of the Red Rectangle nebula. This casts
                   doubts upon proposals that the carriers of these
                   features are the same as those of DIBs seen at
                   slightly shorter wavelengths.},

                   amount of extinction, measured using E(B-V). <P />We
                   have measured equivalent widths of the strongest DIBs
                   (centered at λλ 5780.6 Å, 5797.0 Å, 6196.0 Å,
                   6379.3 Å, 6613.5 Å, and 8620 Å), as well as of CH
                   (near 4300.3 Å) and CH<SUP>+</SUP> (near 4232.5 Å)
                   in high resolution, high S/N ratio échelle spectra
                   from several spectrographs. The equivalent widths of
                   the 8620 DIB in noisy spectra were measured using a
                   template which was constructed using the high quality
                   spectrum of BD+40 4220. DIB relations with the color
                   excess in the range 0.1-2.0 mag were examined. Our
                   analysis demonstrates that all the above mentioned
                   interstellar spectral features (except for, perhaps,
                   6379 DIB) do correlate with E(B-V) relatively tightly
                   (with the Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.8+).
                   Moreover, the observed scatter is apparently not
                   caused by measurement errors but of physical origin.
                   We present several examples where the strength ratios
                   of a DIB/molecule to E(B-V) are different than the
                   average.},

                   observations of the Orion Nebula, made with the
                   Cassegrain echelle spectrograph on the Blanco 4 m
                   telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory
                   (CTIO). The resolution and signal-to-noise ratio make
                   it possible to identify 444 emission lines in the
                   3498-7468 Å range, down to 104 times fainter than
                   Hbeta. We present a detailed atlas of these emission
                   lines along with an analysis of the associated
                   errors. This data set is used to study the velocity
                   field in the Orion Nebula. The forbidden lines split
                   into two distinct groups. The low-ionization group
                   has ions with an ionization potential less than 20
                   eV. Lines of these ions, [O I], [N I], [Ni II], and
                   [Fe II], have recession velocities, relative to the
                   hydrogen lines, of +10 to +15 km s-1. There is a
                   sharp change to the second, high-ionization group,
                   which includes lines of ions with ionization
                   potentials larger than 20 eV, namely, [S II], [O II],
                   [N II], and [Fe III]. These lines have velocities
                   around +3 km s-1, with a slight trend of decreasing
                   velocity with the increasing ionization potential.
                   This is consistent with previously proposed dynamical
                   models in which lines of ions with different
                   ionization potentials originate at different
                   distances from the ionizing stars. Significant
                   acceleration appears to take place across the narrow
                   region where Fe2+ exists. Across this region the gas
                   receives an acceleration of ~2.5×10-5 cm s-2. This
                   provides a constraint on hydrodynamical models. We
                   set a limit He II 4686/Hbeta<7×10-5, which in turn
                   sets a limit to the intensity of the ionizing
                   continuum at energies higher than 54 eV. Modern
                   stellar atmospheres predict a continuum that is far
                   stronger than is present in the region near theta1
                   Ori C.},

                   strong in a variety of emission-line objects. We
                   compute a detailed photoionization model and use it
                   to show that pumping by far-ultraviolet (FUV) stellar
                   radiation previously posited as a general explanation
                   applies to the Orion Nebula (M42) and its companion
                   M43; but, it is unlikely to explain planetary nebulae
                   and supernova remnants. Our models establish that the
                   observed nearly constant equivalent width of [N I]
                   with respect to the dust-scattered stellar continuum
                   depends primarily on three factors: the FUV to
                   visual-band flux ratio of the stellar population, the
                   optical properties of the dust, and the line
                   broadening where the pumping occurs. In contrast, the
                   intensity ratio [N I]/Hbeta depends primarily on the
                   FUV to extreme-ultraviolet ratio, which varies
                   strongly with the spectral type of the exciting star.
                   This is consistent with the observed difference of a
                   factor of five between M42 and M43, which are excited
                   by an O7 and B0.5 star, respectively. We derive a
                   non-thermal broadening of order 5 km s-1 for the [N
                   I] pumping zone and show that the broadening
                   mechanism must be different from the large-scale
                   turbulent motions that have been suggested to explain
                   the line widths in this H II region. A mechanism is
                   required that operates at scales of a few
                   astronomical units, which may be driven by thermal
                   instabilities of neutral gas in the range 1000-3000
                   K. In an Appendix A, we describe how collisional and

  abstract =      {The law of interstellar extinction between
                   wavelengths 3448 and 10500 A has been investigated in
                   five regions of the Milky Way, namely, in Perseus,
                   Orion, Monoceros, Cygnus, and Cepheus. Reddened and
                   virtually unreddened stars of early spectral types
                   were observed at thirty wavelengths with a
                   photoelectric spectrum scanner at Mount Wilson. By
                   adoption of theoretical models for unreddened energy
                   distributions, the mean wavelength dependence of
                   interstellar extinction was calculated for each
                   region. The results for Perseus and Cepheus are
                   similar. In Orion, the wavelength dependence for
                   stars outside the Orion Nebula is different from the
                   dependence within the nebula. The law for Monoceros
                   lies between that for Orion and those of the
                   remaining regions. There is no correlation between
                   the results and galactic structure.},

  abstract =      {New Hubble Space Telescope/STIS optical spectra were
                   obtained for a sample of early-type stars with
                   existing International Ultraviolet Explorer UV
                   spectra. These data were used to construct optical
                   extinction curves whose general properties are
                   discussed elsewhere. In this paper, we identify
                   extinction features in the curves that are wider than
                   diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) but narrower than
                   the well known broadband variability. This
                   intermediate scale structure, or ISS, contains
                   distinct features whose peaks can contribute a few
                   percent to 20% of the total extinction. Most of the
                   ISS variation can be captured by three principal
                   components. We model the ISS with three Drude
                   profiles and show that their strengths and widths
                   vary from one sight line to another, but their
                   central positions are stable, near 4370, 4870, and
                   6300 Å. The very broad structure (VBS) in optical
                   curves appears to be a minimum between the 4870 and
                   6300 Å absorption peaks. We find relations among the
                   fit parameters and provide a physical interpretation
                   of them in terms of a simplistic grain model.
                   Finally, we note that the strengths of the 4370 and
                   4870 Å features are correlated to the strength of
                   the 2175 Å UV bump, but that the 6300 Å feature is
                   not, and that none of the ISS features are related to
                   R(V). However, we verify that the broadband curvature
                   of the continuous optical extinction is strongly
                   related to R(V).},

  abstract =      {Orion's Veil is an absorbing screen that lies along
                   the line of sight to the Orion H II region. It
                   consists of two or more layers of gas that must lie
                   within a few parsecs of the Trapezium cluster. Our
                   previous work considered the Veil as a whole and
                   found that the magnetic field dominates the
                   energetics of the gas in at least one component. Here
                   we use high-resolution STIS UV spectra that resolve
                   the two velocity components in absorption and
                   determine the conditions in each. We derive a volume
                   hydrogen density, 21 cm spin temperature, turbulent
                   velocity, and kinetic temperature for each. We
                   combine these estimates with magnetic field
                   measurements to find that magnetic energy
                   significantly dominates turbulent and thermal
                   energies in one component, while the other component
                   is close to equipartition between turbulent and
                   magnetic energies. We observe H2 absorption for
                   highly excited v, J levels that are photoexcited by
                   the stellar continuum, and detect blueshifted S+2 and
                   P+2 ions. These ions must arise from ionized gas
                   between the mostly neutral portions of the Veil and
                   the Trapezium and shields the Veil from ionizing
                   radiation. We find that this layer of ionized gas is
                   also responsible for He I lambda3889 absorption
                   toward the Veil, which resolves a 40 year old debate
                   on the origin of He I absorption toward the
                   Trapezium. Finally, we determine that the ionized and
                   mostly atomic layers of the Veil will collide in less
                   than 85,000 yr.},

                   6.6, 7.7, 19.7, 31.5, and 37.1 mum. By complementing
                   this observation with archival FORCAST and
                   Herschel/PACS images, we are able to construct a
                   complete infrared spectral energy distribution of the
                   Huygens region in the Orion nebula. Comparing the
                   infrared images with gas tracers, we find that PACS
                   maps trace the molecular cloud, while the FORCAST
                   data trace the photodissociation region (PDR) and the
                   H II region. Analysis of the energetics of the region
                   reveal that the PDR extends for 0.28 pc along the
                   line of sight and that the bar is inclined at an
                   angle of 4°. The infrared and submillimeter images
                   reveal that the Orion bar represents a swept-up shell
                   with a thickness of 0.1 pc. The mass of the shell
                   implies a shock velocity of ~=3 km s-1 and an age of
                   ~=105 years for the H II region. Our analysis shows
                   that the UV and infrared dust opacities in the H II
                   region and the PDR are a factor 5 to 10 lower than in
                   the diffuse interstellar medium. In the ionized gas,
                   Lyalpha photons are a major source of dust heating at
                   distances larger than ~=0.06 pc from theta 1 Ori C.
                   Dust temperatures can be explained if the size of the
                   grains is between 0.1 and 1 mum. We derive the
                   photoelectric heating efficiency of the atomic gas in
                   the Orion bar. The results are in good qualitative
                   agreement with models and the quantitative
                   differences indicate a decreased polycyclic aromatic
                   hydrocarbon abundance in this region.},

                   t<SUP>2</SUP>, of 0.050 and 0.016 for the shock and
                   nebular components, respectively. Interestingly, we
                   obtain almost coincident t<SUP>2</SUP> values for
                   both components from the analysis of the intensity
                   ratios of HeI lines. We find significant departures

                   flux ratios of lines of high principal quantum number
                   n. We analyse the ionization structure of HH 202-S,
                   finding enough evidence to conclude that the flow of
                   HH 202-S has compressed the ambient gas inside the
                   nebula trapping the ionization front. We measure a
                   strong increase of the total abundances of nickel and
                   iron in the shock component, the abundance pattern
                   and the results of photoionization models for both
                   components are consistent with the partial
                   destruction of dust after the passage of the shock
                   wave in HH 202-S.<p/> Based on observations collected

  abstract =      {<BR /> Aims: We present a study of protoplanetary
                   disks in spatially resolved low-mass binary stars in
                   the well-known Orion nebula cluster (ONC) to assess
                   the impact of binarity on the properties of
                   circumstellar disks. This is currently the largest
                   such study in a clustered high-stellar-density
                   star-forming environment, as opposed to previous
                   studies, which have mostly been focussed on the
                   young, low-stellar-density Taurus association. We
                   particularly aim to determine the presence of
                   magnetospheric accretion and dust disks for each
                   binary component, and measure the overall disk
                   frequency. <BR /> Methods: We carried out spatially
                   resolved adaptive-optics-assisted observations to
                   acquire near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of
                   26 binaries in the ONC, and determine stellar
                   parameters such as effective temperatures, spectral
                   types, luminosities, and masses, as well as accretion
                   properties and near-infrared excesses for the
                   individual binary components. On the basis of our
                   medium resolution K-band spectroscopy, we infer the
                   presence of magnetospheric accretion around each
                   binary component by measuring the strength of the
                   Brackett-γ emission. The accretion disk frequency
                   among the ONC binaries is then estimated from
                   Bayesian statistics. The observed disk signatures,
                   measured accretion luminosities, and mass accretion
                   rates are investigated with respect to the binary
                   separation, mass ratios, and distance to the center
                   of the ONC. <BR /> Results: A fraction of
                   40<SUP>+10</SUP><SUB>-9</SUB>% of the binary
                   components in the sample can be inferred to be T
                   Tauri stars possessing an accretion disk. This is
                   only marginally smaller than the disk fraction of
                   single stars of ~50% in the ONC. We find that disks
                   in wide binaries of &gt;200 AU separation are
                   consistent with random pairing, while the evolution
                   of circumprimary and circumsecondary disks is
                   observed to be synchronized in close binaries
                   (separations &lt; 200 AU). Circumbinary disks appear
                   to be unsuitable to explain this difference.
                   Furthermore, we identify several mixed pairs of
                   accreting and non-accreting components, suggesting
                   that these systems are common and that there is no
                   preference for either the more or less massive
                   component to evolve faster. The derived accretion
                   luminosities and mass accretion rates of the ONC
                   binary components are of similar magnitude as those
                   for both ONC single stars and binaries in the Taurus
                   star-forming region. The paper concludes with a
                   discussion of the (presumably weak) connection
                   between the presence of inner accretion disks in
                   young binary systems and the existence of planets in
                   stellar multiples. <P />Based on observations

                   neutral gas lying between us and the main ionizing
                   stars of the Orion Nebula. It is visible in 21 cm H I
                   absorption and in optical and UV absorption lines of
                   H I and other species. Toward θ<SUP>1</SUP> Ori C,
                   the veil has two remarkable properties, a high
                   magnetic field (~100 μG) and a surprising lack of
                   H<SUB>2</SUB>, given its total column density. Here
                   we compute photoionization models of the veil to
                   establish its gas density and its distance from
                   θ<SUP>1</SUP> Ori C. We use a greatly improved model
                   of the H<SUB>2</SUB> molecule that determines level
                   populations in 10<SUP>5</SUP> rotational/vibrational
                   levels and provides improved estimates of
                   H<SUB>2</SUB> destruction via the Lyman-Werner bands.
                   Our best-fit photoionization models place the veil
                   1-3 pc in front of the star at a density of
                   10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>.
                   Magnetic energy dominates the energy of nonthermal
                   motions in at least one of the 21 cm H I velocity
                   components. Therefore, the veil is the first
                   interstellar environment in which magnetic dominance
                   appears to exist. We find that the low ratio of
                   H<SUB>2</SUB>/H<SUP>0</SUP> (&lt;10<SUP>-4</SUP>) is
                   a consequence of high UV flux incident on the veil
                   due to its proximity to the Trapezium stars and the
                   absence of small grains in the region.},

                   material near the Trapezium region of the Orion
                   Nebula. This was necessary because recent high
                   spectral resolution spectra of optical emission lines
                   and imaging spectra in the [C II] 158 micron line
                   have shown that there are new velocity systems

                   lying between Theta 1 Ori C and the Main Ionization

                   generated with the spectral synthesis code Cloudy
                   were compared with the surface brightness of the

                   lines seen in the Trapezium stars, distances from
                   Theta 1 Ori C, were derived, with the closest,
                   highest ionization layer being 1.3 pc. The line of
                   sight distance of this layer is comparable with the
                   size of the inner Huygens Region in the plane of the
                   sky. These layers are all blueshifted with respect to
                   the Orion Nebula Cluster of stars, probably because
                   of the pressure of a hot central bubble created by
                   Theta 1 Ori C's stellar wind. We find velocity
                   components that are ascribed to both sides of this
                   bubble. Our analysis shows that the foreground [C II]
                   158 micron emission is part of a previously
                   identified layer that forms a portion of a recently

                   between the H II region and the neutral cloud (the
                   ionization front IF) is moving with a velocity vIF
                   into the PDR. This situation applies, for example, to
                   PDRs associated with photoevaporating clumps, blister
                   H II regions, and expanding H II regions. Although
                   the chemical and temperature structure of the PDR
                   achieves a steady state value in the frame of the IF,
                   the chemical and thermal structure of these
                   nonequilibrium models differ from static equilibrium
                   values because of the advection of molecular gas
                   through the PDR toward the IF. We have studied PDRs
                   with hydrogen nucleus densities n ranging from 104 to
                   106 cm-3 and FUV fluxes chi = 104-105 times the local
                   average FUV flux, such as is appropriate for many
                   PDRs associated with dense H II regions near O stars.
                   The velocity of the ionization front vIF is varied
                   between 0 and 1 km s-1, the range predicted for the
                   advance of a D-type ionization front into a
                   photoevaporating PDR. We predict intensities of the
                   [O I] 63 mu m and the [C II] 158 mu m fine-structure
                   lines, the pure rotational H2 0-0 S(0) 28.22 mu m,
                   S(1) 17.03 mu m, S(2) 12.28 mu m, S(3) 9.67 mu m,
                   S(4) 8.03 mu m, and S(5) 6.91 mu m lines; the H2 v =
                   1-0 S(1) and H2 v = 2-1 S(1) vibrational lines; and
                   the CO 1-0 and 2-1 rotational lines. We find that
                   there is no H/H2 photodissociation front for models
                   with chi /n <= 0.2vIF, where n is in cm-3 and vIF is
                   in km s-1. The H2 is rapidly advected to the IF
                   before it can photodissociate. For chi /n > 0.2vIF an
                   H/H2 photodissociation front exists, but the front
                   moves progressively nearer to the cloud surface as
                   chi /n declines. We also find that the nonequilibrium
                   models always have a well-defined C+/CO transition
                   layer, because the CO does not self-shield as
                   effectively as H2 and the CO photodissociation
                   timescale is shorter than the flow time across the
                   PDR. This layer is, however, shifted slightly nearer
                   to the cloud surface compared to the equilibrium
                   models. The [C II] and [O I] fine-structure line
                   intensities are relatively insensitive to vIF in the
                   range studied, because of the relative rapid
                   photodissociation of CO and photoionization of C I.
                   We conclude that nonequilibrium effects have a
                   relatively minor effect on previous analysis of the
                   physical conditions of PDRs based on [O I], [C II],
                   and IR continuum intensities. The CO low-J lines can
                   be a factor of 2 stronger compared to the static
                   equilibrium models. The H2 rotational and vibrational
                   lines can be enhanced by a factor of 3. We consider
                   the Orion Bar PDR and conclude that nonequilibrium
                   effects are probably minor.},

                   ionized outflow away from the cloud, an ionization
                   front, a layer of photodissociated gas, a
                   photodissociation front, and a shock wave preceding
                   the photodissociation front. We show that the
                   properties of the structure are determined by two
                   dimensionless parameters psi and sigma, and by the
                   Alfvén speed in the preshock gas. For a broad range
                   of parameters of interest, the ionization front and
                   the hydrogen photodissociation front do not separate,
                   the H2 photodissociation and photoionization take
                   place together, and a classical hydrogen
                   "photodissociation region" (PDR) does not exist. We
                   also show that even when a distinct PDR exists, in
                   many cases the dissociation front propagates too
                   rapidly for the usual stationary models of PDRs to be
                   applicable. We discuss several famous PDRs, e.g., in
                   M 17 and Orion, and conclude that they cannot be
                   described by equilibrium PDR models.},

  abstract =      {Recent Herschel and ALMA observations of
                   Photodissociation Regions (PDRs) have revealed the
                   presence of a high thermal pressure (P ~ 10^7-10^8 K
                   cm-3) thin compressed layer at the PDR surface where
                   warm molecular tracer emission (e.g. CH+, SH+, high-J
                   CO, H2,...) originate. These high pressures
                   (unbalanced by the surrounding environment) and a
                   correlation between pressure and incident FUV field
                   (G0) seem to indicate a dynamical origin with the
                   radiation field playing an important role in driving
                   the dynamics. We investigate whether photoevaporation
                   of the illuminated edge of a molecular cloud could
                   explain these high pressures and pressure-UV field
                   correlation. We developed a 1D hydrodynamical PDR
                   code coupling hydrodynamics, EUV and FUV radiative
                   transfer and time-dependent thermo-chemical
                   evolution. We applied it to a 1D plane-parallel
                   photoevaporation scenario where a UV-illuminated
                   molecular cloud can freely evaporate in a surrounding
                   low-pressure medium. We find that photoevaporation
                   can produce high thermal pressures and the observed
                   P-G0 correlation, almost independently from the
                   initial gas density. In addition, we find that
                   constant-pressure PDR models are a better
                   approximation to the structure of photoevaporating
                   PDRs than constant-density PDR models, although
                   moderate pressure gradients are present. Strong
                   density gradients from the molecular to the neutral
                   atomic region are found, which naturally explain the
                   large density contrasts (1-2 orders of magnitude)
                   derived from observations of different tracers. The
                   photoevaporating PDR is preceded by a low velocity
                   shock (a few km/s) propagating into the molecular
                   cloud. Photoevaporating PDR models offer a promising
                   explanation to the recent observational evidence of
                   dynamical effects in PDRs.},

                   Exporting the atomic data into external data files
                   has enabled many new large datasets to be
                   incorporated into the code. The use of the complete

                   default, which predicts significantly more lines than
