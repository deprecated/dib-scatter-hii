* Geometry of the Orion Bar
This is somewhere to organize my thoughts, which are currently spread out over too many places


** Evidence that the Bar i-front is convex cylindrical
1. Profile of the PAH emission, for instance JWST F335M
   - This is much steeper on the illuminated side than on the neutral side
   - To first order it looks like the "horn" profile that you get from a homogeneous optically thin emitting shell
   - Really, the emissivity should be proportional to \(n exp(-\tau)\) where n is local density and \tau is FUV optical depth from star.
2. The 21 cm absorption components
   - These have positions behind the i-front, which only makes sense in the surface is convex
   - See [[id:2AC0209C-557E-41B4-97C3-6E5D9EF0B103][Model for 21 cm continuum and line]] in [[file:absorption-6634.org]]


** What is radius of curvature of i-front
- Can we get a consistent value from different tracers?
- And is it consistent with the radius from 13CO peak (0.05 pc)?
- [O I] has width of about 0.001, so factor of 50
** Relation between the i-front and the d-front
- Odd that they are both so straight and parallel to one another, given that they are quite separated
- This is an argument for an overarching global geometry
  - Possibly a cylinder with center at the 13CO peak
** What is happening with the sharpest bits of the i-front?
- There are some sections 
** What is going on with the gap between the ionized emission and the neutral emission?
- This is most obvious in the NIR broad bands
  - There is a component from the H lines and atomic continuum that peaks on the ionized side
  - And there is a component from the PAH and/or scattered continuum, which peaks on the neutral side
  - And there is a gap between them
  - Is this a natural prediction of ionization front models?
    - See for instance Henney:2005b
  - And what does the size of the gap depend on?
  - It seems a bit large to be due to the partially ionized zone at the i-front
  - We could look at how the gap size is correlated with, for instance, the width of the [O I] emission layer
    - It looks like it correlates very well
    - Around 5:35:22.8938 -5:24:32.072 we have a large separation and a very fat [O I] peak
    - Both of order 10 arcsec = 20 mpc, whereas typically it is 4 times less
    - With electron density of 5000, and ion faction of 0.5, then ionizing photon mean free path at threshold is 0.01 mpc, which is tiny
    - Conclusion is that there must be an extended partially ionized zone, which is not predicted for ionization fronts!
  - *Is it maybe a recombination front instead?*
** What causes the disruption of the Bar due S of the Trapezium?
- This seems to be cased by the HH528 bowshock, which traps the ionization front
- The original ionization front can be seen to ruin on in a straight(ish) line behind
  - This can be seen in the O I and [O I] lines for instance
- The PAH emission does not have such a clear structure here, with no sharp edges
- There is a nostril region between the original and current i-front
** Why is there no sharp H_2 emission around th2A and farther NE? :ATTACH:

:END:
- Around HH 204 and to the SW, the H_2 emission is very sharp and filamentary
- But in NE portion, it is much more diffuse
