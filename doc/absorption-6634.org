* Absorption at 6634 \AA in Orion Nebula
+ [[https://www.evernote.com/l/ACSenDsvfD1AsZwl6SJxcieZcyrDhIYlOVw][Public link to Evernote note]]

** Things still to do for paper
1. [ ] Finish theory of radiative transfer
   - Calculate expected brightness
   - Why is it so much higher in Orion S
   - Also, compare O^0 absorption with H^0 Raman absorption 
2. [ ] Analysis of absorption line profile
   - How much can be done from MUSE data
   - Sort out the Keck lines
     - Find best spectra and co-add them
     - Determine width, shift, etc
3. [ ] Use tetrablok algorithm on images
   - Make some nice figures
4. [ ] Extract a small region around 244-440
   - At full resolution on linux server
   - Do an analysis of this proplyd
   - Again, maybe for another paper where we can include the Keck spectra
5. [X] Make image of different extinction measurements
   - Scattered in green
   - Optically thick in red
   - Put screenshot in [[https://www.evernote.com/l/ACRuDljr2ktEsohBH1p0pHiM81GSFWLeIso][Evernote]]  
   - Or maybe punt to another paper
6. [ ] Remove continuum from [C I] line
7. [X] Look at Bally STIS spectra
   - See [[id:2E94DD95-D60A-4C3E-A5C8-5356F63901B9][Bally GO8324 - mainly UV but also optical of LV knots and HST10]]
   - Should have Ha spectra that include the wings
   - Maybe 50 km/s velocity resolution
   - No, these are none of them any good

** Relation to Raman-scattered wings of H\alpha
+ See Dopita:2016a
  + These are pumped by continuum or O I 1025.76, which is very close to Ly \beta 1025.72
    + Wavelength in H\alpha frame: 6562.79 + (1025.76 - 1025.72) 40.96 = 6564.4284
    + Redshifted by 3e5 (6564.4284 - 6562.79)/6562.79 = 75 km/s
  + Also, secondary component pumped by Si II 1023.70, which gives a peak at 6480.1
    + Test my understanding of scale factor
    + (1023.70 - 1025.72) 40.96 = -82.7392
    + 6562.79 - 82.7392 = 6480.05 QED
+ *This gives another possibility for the 6634 origin*
  + Could be a stellar absorption line just redward of Ly \beta
  + Raman scattering causes wavelength differences \Delta\lambda/\lambda from Ly \beta center (1025.72 \AA) to be mapped to differences 6.4 \Delta\lambda/\lambda from H\alpha line center
    - This is (1 - 1/9) / (1/4 - 1/9) = 6.4
    - This is factor for velocity shifts (\propto \Delta\lambda/\lambda), so for \Delta\lambda itself, the factor is squared: 40.96
    - So 6634 - 6563 = 70 \AA, so 70/40.96 = 1.709 \AA at Ly \beta => 1027.43 \AA (vacuum)
    - *I have solved the mystery!!!*
      - It is the 1027.43051 and 1027.43125 components of the O I resonance line
        - These are transitions from the J=1 level, which is 0.019622 eV above the ground (J=2) level, but it should be populated according to statistical weight so long as T > 0.019622 eV/k = 228 K
        - There is also a 1028.15710 component from the J=0 level, which should give a line at 6562.79 + (1028.15710 - 1025.72) 40.96 = 6662.613616
        - /Which is what I thought was Si III 6662.90 !!!/
        - Velocities in Ly\beta domain are +500 and +712 km/s 
          - And the J_1=2 triplet is [+12.2, +12.4, +12.7] km/s
          - Or around +80 km/s
        - All lines of multiplet

      - What is the observed width of the O I lines, and what do they correspond to in the FUV domain?
        - FWHM is about 4.5 pix or 3.8 \AA, as opposed to 3 pix = 2.5 \AA for the emission lines
          - FWZI is 9.5 as opposed to 6 pixels
        - This is 174 km/s as opposed to 114 km/s, so this gives a instrument-corrected width of 130 km/s \to 20 km/s in FUV
        - This is very broad and can't be thermal or even non-thermal kinematic
        - Must be due to line-center \tau \gg 1, so could use a curve of growth on the EW
        - Also, this means that residual emission at line center is giving us the line-center source function!
  + Possible lines in blue wing:
    + /I don't actually believe any of these/
      + More plausible that they are gaps between emission lines
    + 6494.75 \to 1025.72 + (6494.75 - 6562.79)/40.96 = 1024.06
      + There is S I at 1023.91, which should give 6562.79 + (1023.91 - 1025.72) 40.96 = 6488.65
        + But that is not close enough
      + Si II at 1020.6989 and 1023.7001
        + 6357.13, 6480.05
        + The 6480.05 line /might/ be detected, but the absorption looks to be centered on 6481.15, which would be 0.01 \AA redder in FUV, whereas claimed wavelength accuracy is 0.0007 \AA
      + Fe II] intercombination line at 1024.14514 (no A-value given) \to 6498.3 \AA
        + Does correspond to a weak but consistent dip
        + Although we can't rule out weak optical emission lines
    + If the dips are just gaps between emission lines, then the lines are
      + 6521.1 weak/broad
      + 6516 very weak
      + 6510.9 mainly ionized (maybe O II)
      + 6505.8 also mainly ionized
      + 6501.55 (maybe O II)
      + 6498.15 SKY definitely
      + 6470.1 SKY
      + 6465 SKY - not to be confused with strong 6462 C II
  + One more in the red wing
    + 6708.5 \to 1025.72 + (6708.5 - 6562.79)/40.96 = 1029.28 \AA
    + Strong in Orion S on side near Trapezium
    + Weak in Bar region
    + Could be Cl I 1029.34325
    + But this should also give 1028.17391 \to 6663.3 \AA, which is almost on top of the red component of the O I multiplet so would be hidden
    + Variation with position might be due to Cl II being dominant in Bar (density effect on Cl^+/Cl^0 ratio)
  + The near wings - are they real?
    + I am not sure
    + There is a flat bit in the spectrum from 6569 \to 6574
      + \Delta\lambda = +6 \to +11 \AA or V = +275 \to +500 km/s
    + And again from 6554 \to 6557
      + \Delta\lambda = -9 \to -6 or V = -275 \to -410 km/s
    + There seems to be a slight change with position, at the Bar at least
      + Smaller \Delta\lambda comes from more ionized regions
      + This is what we expect because the larger cross section closer to line center implies \tau = 1 comes from a smaller column
      + \Delta\lambda = 10 \AA @ H\alpha means 
  + There is O VI doublet at 1037.62, 1031.93 but this is a very strong P Cygni profile that absorbs everything up to and past the Ly \beta line
    + See Fig 23 of Leitherer:2010a, which shows population synthesis spectra
    + There is a lot of H_2 (and C II, O I) absorption between 1035 \to 1040, which makes this hard to see on the observed FUSE spectra, see Fig 20 of Pellerin:2002a
    + Inside the nebula, things will be very different since some of these lines could be in emission instead of absorption
      + [ ] *run Cloudy model* to see if we can get predicted spectrum in PDR
        - See what we have got from the [[file:~/Dropbox/cloudy-dust-charging/cloudy-dust-charging.org][cloudy-dust-charging]] project
    + This is mentioned in Luridiana:2009a
    + But note that the difference between O VI and Ly\beta is 1031.93 - 1025.72 = 6.21 \AA, which corresponds to 1800 km/s, whereas velocity of thC wind is only 1200 km/s
      + So it doesn't get all the way to H\beta - the blue edge will be at 1031.93 (1 - 1200/3e5) = 1027.8 \AA
      + In the H\alpha domain this is 6562.79 + (1027.8 - 1025.72) 40.96 = 6648 \AA
+ Look at variation of the raman wings, and correlations with 6634 absorption
+ Given that Dopita has narrower line than us, it might absorb more than just the Raman pseudo-continuum

**** Conclusions based on Cloudy model spectra
+ The ~dustrad~ models all stop at 4000 K, so just on neutral side of i-front
+ There are a variety of column densities, depending on the ionization parameter (proportional to (Q n)^{1/3})
+ Lines are not properly resolved in the output - look like triangles
+ Ly\alpha is seen in emission in the ~total~ spectrum, which is transmitted plus reflected
+ Ly\beta is in absorption in all spectra
  + Absorption depth seems slightly less in transmitted and total spectra
  + 1025.72 \AA = 0.889 Ryd
  + The reddest O I component is at 1028.16 = 0.887 Ryd
  + The Cloudy continuum mesh points are at [..., 0.8850, 0.8880, 0.8909, ...]
    + [..., 1024, 1027, 1030, ...] in \AA
  + This corresponds to resolving power R = 1025/(2 3) = 171 so clearly insufficient to see details in spectrum
  + We need to use the ~Save fine continuum [range, merge]~ command to see it better
    + Fine continuum has R = 1.737e+05, or 1.7 km/s, which would be 10.9 km/s at H\alpha, which is plenty fine enough
+ Continuum across Ly\beta rises to red, but only 10% in 50\AA
+ Stellar emission line at about 1045 \AA = 0.87 Ryd
+ Important caveat from Hazy
  : In general the treatment of scattering is very geometry dependent. The output produced by the save continuum commands does not include the pumped part of the line contribution. This is correct if the continuum source is included in the beam, but is not if only the gas is observed.
  + This is because absorption and emission cancel out when integrated over the line profile
  + So I think it is OK in our case, since the spectrum as seen by the neutral gas /does/ include the transmitted stellar continuum
+ 


**** TODO [#A] Run more cloudy models
+ Save fine continuum (see above)
+ Stop at various depths
+ Dig out atmosphere models for Trapezium
**** Further spectra for different models

*** Correlation between 6634 and Raman wings for Orion
+ Choose suitable ranges - use the 8x8 binned cube
+ Regions free of any strong lines:
  + 6410 \to 6450 \AA = 31 \to 78 pix
  + 6760 \to 6810 \AA = 442 \to 502 pix (some C II lines but super weak)
  + [ ] Maybe we could divide each continuum range in two to give 4 sections, and take median of each
    + This would be insensitive to absorption or emission lines as long as there are not too many of them
    + Then fit quadratic through the 4 points
+ Regions for Red Raman wing

*** The supposed Si II fluoresced bump
+ Dopita sees this at 6470 \to 6480
+ We see nothing there
+ But we do see a bulge at 6530 near the bar
*** Other H lines
+ H beta has the wings
+ Paschen line are too weak to see the wings, and too many other lines in the way


*** Other weak lines in range
+ 6401 [Ni III] + Ne I
  + Check if [Ni III] 6401/6534 tells us something
+ 6462 C II recomb
+ 6666 [Ni II]
+ Another notch at 6530, or a gap between two lines
  + There is [N II] 6527 and [Ni III] 6534
  + Those two lines are clearly seen in Dopita spectra
  + And in MUSE spectra too
+ [ ] 6544.3 seen in SPM spectra - what is it?
*** What H\alpha rest wavelength to use
+ The Raman scattering has to be 1s \to 3p \to 2s by E1 selection rule (\Delta\ell = \pm1)
+ 
** TODO [#A] The [C I] line
Fit the continuum and remove it
** Relation with foreground extinction
+ Show that the 6634 feature is not correlated with reddening
+ But the other DIB features are - maybe
*** TODO [#A] Extinction at the Bright Bar
+ Compare 6563/4681 with 7136/7751 and 9229/6563
+ Strange dip in Raman brightness at the bar
  + Is this caused by dust in ionized gas (will cause big drop in source function)
*** Correlation between the different reddening measures 
*** Correlation between reddening and DIB
** Stellar absorption lines

    + 219-355 - 5:35:21.8801 -5:23:54.789
    + 159-350 - 5:35:15.8718 -5:23:48.515
    + 210-349 - 5:35:21.0189 -5:23:48.808

    + 181-245 - 5:35:18.0745 -5:22:45.107
    + 
  + 6496 - shows up nearly everywhere
    + Accompanied by weaker lines: 6483, 6463, 6451, 6440, 6421, 6402, etc

** Comparison with other lines in Orion S
+ CO has peak at around +9 km/s LSR = 28 km/s heliocentric
  + Kong:2018a
  + There is a blue wing, but that may be related to molecular outflow
+ [N I] line has peak at 29 km/s heliocentric
  + From Keck spectra of slit p79, assuming -4 km/s heliocentric correction

** Look at other Orion datasets
+ [X] Keck proplyd spectra
  + Unfortunately, we have an inter-order gap from 6622 \to 6649 \AA, which our line falls right in the middle of
  + /However/ the 6662.6 absorption line should be visible
    + Maybe see it on the following spectra
      + In Keck2, jw73b, j71b, j70b, j69b, j68b, j67b, j66b, j65b - last is best
        + C3 slit, which is 28 x 0.861 arcsec with R = 50,000
        + Also p79-ff, which is in Keck1 (C2 slit)
        + j65 and p79 are both from similar pointings called 150-353
        + This is the base of the HH 529 jet
      + Also in p73 clearly (170-337)
        + And in p74 super strong - but is it stellar? I think so - mainly from one star
        + In p77 (180-331) just about visible, but p87 has nothing
        + in p84 (244-440) is visible, but again looks like star although it could be disk
      + Distance between 6666.8 and 6678.15 is
        + 607 - 387 = 220 pix
        + 6678.15 - 6666.8 = 11.35 \AA
        + 0.0516 \AA per pix (= 2.32 km/s, sounds right)
      + Absorption feature ranges between [308, 324], so [-79, -63] pix from 6666.8
        + 6666.8 + [-79, -63] 0.0516 = [6662.7236, 6663.5492]
        + We wanted 6662.6, so it is a bit to red
        + Width is 0.8256 \AA = 37 km/s => 5.8 km/s
        + If line center is 6663.1364, then redshifted by 0.5 \AA = 3.5 km/s with respect to [Ni II]
          + That is, assuming that [Ni II] rest wavelength is accurate
          + This might be showing velocity shifts between ionization front and PDR
          + Including maybe back scattering, which gives double relative redshift
+ [X] Adal spectra
  + /Resolution in red is not as good as I thought/
    + Pixels are 0.83 \AA = 40 km/s at H\alpha, and resolution should be at best 2x this, so 80 km/s or R = 4000
    + This is very similar to MUSE, but not quite as good I don't think
  + We see it for POS 6 in Orion S - strangely not as deep as one might expect
  + POS 4 near Trapezium
  + POS 1 near Trapezium
  + POS 2 crosses Bright Bar
  + Blue spectra are all high resolution, but there are symmetrical ghosts around all the bright lines, which makes it impossible to see any possible wings on H beta for instance
+ [X] O'Dell & Harris
  + The spectral resolution is not very good - we do see the absorption, but only just
+ [X] Manuel PPAK spectra
  + Good example is [[file:~/Dropbox/RubinWFC3/Tsquared/manu-region-specplot-r-6600-6800-x-250-y-350-w0400-h0200.jpg][file:~/Dropbox/RubinWFC3/Tsquared/manu-region-specplot-r-6600-6800-x-250-y-350-w0400-h0200.jpg]]
+ [ ] STIS
  + I don't seem to have the files any more
    + I used to have a ~Work/HST-STIS~ folder, but seems to be missing - maybe on external disk
    + They do seem to be in ~/fs/nil/other0/will/orion-stis~ on linux server
  + Best bet would seem to be from Bally program GO8324
  + There is a 6581 \to 6867 \AA spectrum in a slit from LV2 to LV6, same as for the NUV lines
  + See [[file:~/Dropbox/STIS-LV/stis-lv.org][file:~/Dropbox/STIS-LV/stis-lv.org]]

* Absorption at 6634 \AA in other regions
** TODO RCW 49
+ Illuminated by the massive cluster Westerlund 2, supposedly second most massive in Milky Way
+ Zeidler:2018a
+ They seem to have a lot of MUSE data - including deep fields
  + Now downloading to [[file:~/Work/Muse-Hii-Data/RCW49/][file:~/Work/Muse-Hii-Data/RCW49/]]
+ We see the 6614 absorption line, but that seems to be scattered stellar
  + Or DIB - see below
+ [2019-08-06 Tue 22:10] I don't see any evidence of the Raman scattering or the 6634 line in what I have looked at so far
** 30 Doradus: Tarantula
+ I see absolutely nothing
+ Files are at
  + [[file:~/Work/Muse-Hii-Data/30Dor]]
+ [2019-08-01 Thu]  *I do see the line!!*
+ Much weaker than Orion, but it looks very similar
+ We are looking in an 8x8 arcsec box
+ A good place is centered on 84.642977 -69.10802
+ Minimum absorption is at observed wavelength of 6638.74 and 6637.49 - about halfway between them, so 6638.1 \AA
+ So is rest wavelength is 6633.9 then V = +190 km/s, whereas [N II] is at +250
  + From below, we have a DIB with 6632.85, which would give 5.25 \AA or +240, which is much better
+ Absorption depth:
  + Mean: (193.36 - 188.56)/193.36 = 0.0248
  + Median: (186.45 - 181.59)/186.45 = 0.026
  + So less than 3%, whereas in Orion S it is up to 8%
*** Other lines with different behavior
+ Si III 5740 is seen in emission and absorption (in some stars)
+ DIB 5781 is seen in absorption everywhere - need to check if depth scales with reddening
+ 
+ He II 4686 broad emission line is seen everywhere
  + Can be used to track scattered starlight from the WR stars (there are about 3 of them in the A field)
  + Some stars have absorption in this line, but that doesn't seem to be imprinted on the nebula much
  + There is an artefact at 4688 \to 4691 \AA in the top center of field A
    + At first I thought there was some narrow absorption, but it is in bizarre horizontal stripes
    + Also around 6252 \AA in same region

* Characteristics of Orion PDRs
+ Bright Bar
  + Edge on
+ Orion S

* Absorption line profile
+ Can we get a good handle on how broad it is
+ Make a mask that includes the best points (do this for each object)
+ Adjust the wavelengths according to the velocities maybe
  + This would give better sampling of the profile
  + But which line do we use? No guarantee that absorbing medium shares kinematics of the emitting gas, although in Carina this will probably be true
+ If width is not too small, could be DIB
  + The 6614 \AA DIB (which we don't see) has a width of 50 km/s or 1.1 \AA, which we would not well resolve (see Krelowski:2018a, pronounced KreWoVski because it is a ł)
  + In fact, Galazutdinov:2000a show a DIB at 6632.85, which might possibly be our feature
    + It isn't listed as new, so it must be in previous papers too
    + It is only seen in highly reddened stars, not in HD 23180
** TODO [#A] Co-adding Keck spectra to get a less noisy profile

* Explanations for absorption
** Summary
1. Really a gap between two weak emission line forests
   - Not consistent with Orion, which shows smooth continuum
2. Stellar absorption line that is scattered
   - Late B stars have the N III 6633.9 line
   - But they also have other lines
     - E.g. O II 6641.031
3. DIB
   - I think this is the most likely
   - Need to compare with 5782 and 6278 bands
     - Those are correlated with reddening
     - But 6634 is not
   - Note that DIBs are thought to be molecular, according to Krełowski:
     #+begin_quote
     The nearly constant positions and nearly unchanged profiles of DIBs, irrespective of the line of sight, point to free gas-phase molecules as the carriers of these bands. [...] 
     #+end_quote
* Antecedents for Raman scattering
** Raman scattering theory
+ Hubeny & Mihalas book
+ 
*** Wavelength mapping between Ly\beta and H\alpha domain
+ Let \nu_0 be pre-scattered and \nu_1 be post-scattered frequency
  + \Delta\nu_1 = \Delta\nu_0 for Raman scattering
  + \lambda_1 = c/\nu_1 => d\lambda_1/d\nu_1 = -c / \nu_1^2 = -\lambda_1^2 / c 
  + \Delta\lambda_1 = d\lambda_1/d\nu_1 \Delta\nu_1 = -\lambda_1^2 \Delta\nu_1 / c
  + \Delta\lambda_0 = -\lambda_0^2 \Delta\nu_0 / c
  + \Delta\lambda_1 / \Delta\lambda_0 = (\lambda_1^2 / \lambda_0^2) (\Delta\nu_1 / \Delta\nu_0) = (\lambda_1 / \lambda_0)^2
+ So wavelength differences \Delta\lambda transform as \lambda^2
+ And velocity differences \Delta{}u = c \Delta\lambda / \lambda scale as \lambda
+ Velocity-scale factor between Ly\beta and H\alpha is \lambda_1 / \lambda_0 = (1 - 1/9) / (1/4 - 1/9) = 6.4
+ Wavelength-scale factor is 40.96
*** Redo everything in vacuum wavenumbers
+ This is the only way that makes sense

+ So, with two decimal places in the wave numbers, we get for the first H\alpha component: 6564.52269355 +/- 4.30929581942e-3
  + This is much less precise than the 4e-8 \AA claimed on the wavelengths, but does this matter?
  + 4e-3 is only 0.2 km/s, which is small
  + For Ly lines the wavelength precision is greater: 1025.72182096 +/- 1.05210525399e-4, which gives 0.03 km/s

** Symbiotic stars
+ Lots of work
  + Schmid:1989a
    + O VI lines Raman scatter off Ly\beta to give 6830, 7088 \AA bands
    + This is much further from resonance, so requires much larger column densities than for the H\alpha wings
    + E.g, 6830 - 6563 = 267 \AA
    + Whereas, our wings go out to 6700 - 6563 = 137 \AA
    + So they have 4 times lower cross section for that
    + Also, they have flux ratio 6830/6563 of about 0.05
    + We have 3e4/1.5e9 = 2e-5
      + 3e4 is measured around 6700 \AA, d\lambda = 137 \AA
      + 2.2e5 at 6600 \AA gives Raman/Core of 1.5e-4 for d\lambda = 37 \AA
      + So we would expect 14 times higher, whereas we observe 2.2e5/3e4 = 7.3 /probably the 6700 region is contaminated with weak lines/
    + So, our prediction for 6830/6563 would be 1.5e-4 (37/267)**2 = 2.9e-6
      + This is 6e-5 times what is observed in symbiotic stars
      + So, if this were all down to column density, we would require a *1e4 times smaller column*
      + Although there will also be a dependence on F(Ly\beta) / F(H\alpha), where Ly\beta is measured in the neutral slab
