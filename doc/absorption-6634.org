* Absorption at 6634 \AA in Orion Nebula
+ [[https://www.evernote.com/l/ACSenDsvfD1AsZwl6SJxcieZcyrDhIYlOVw][Public link to Evernote note]]

** Relation to Raman-scattered wings of H\alpha
+ See Dopita:2016a
  + These are pumped by continuum or O I 1025.76, which is very close to Ly \beta 1025.72
    + Wavelength in H\alpha frame: 6562.79 + (1025.76 - 1025.72) 40.96 = 6564.4284
    + Redshifted by 3e5 (6564.4284 - 6562.79)/6562.79 = 75 km/s
  + Also, secondary component pumped by Si II 1023.70, which gives a peak at 6480.1
    + Test my understanding of scale factor
    + (1023.70 - 1025.72) 40.96 = -82.7392
    + 6562.79 - 82.7392 = 6480.05 QED
+ *This gives another possibility for the 6634 origin*
  + Could be a stellar absorption line just redward of Ly \beta
  + Raman scattering causes wavelength differences \Delta\lambda/\lambda from Ly \beta center (1025.72 \AA) to be mapped to differences 6.4 \Delta\lambda/\lambda from H\alpha line center
    - This is (1 - 1/9) / (1/4 - 1/9) = 6.4
    - This is factor for velocity shifts (\propto \Delta\lambda/\lambda), so for \Delta\lambda itself, the factor is squared: 40.96
    - So 6634 - 6563 = 70 \AA, so 70/40.96 = 1.709 \AA at Ly \beta => 1027.43 \AA (vacuum)
    - *I have solved the mystery!!!*
      - It is the 1027.43051 and 1027.43125 components of the O I resonance line
        - These are transitions from the J=1 level, which is 0.019622 eV above the ground (J=2) level, but it should be populated according to statistical weight so long as T > 0.019622 eV/k = 228 K
        - There is also a 1028.15710 component from the J=0 level, which should give a line at 6562.79 + (1028.15710 - 1025.72) 40.96 = 6662.613616
        - /Which is what I thought was Si III 6662.90 !!!/
  + There is O VI doublet at 1037.62, 1031.93 but this is a very strong P Cygni profile that absorbs everything up to and past the Ly \beta line
    + See Fig 23 of Leitherer:2010a, which shows population synthesis spectra
    + There is a lot of H_2 (and C II, O I) absorption between 1035 \to 1040, which makes this hard to see on the observed FUSE spectra, see Fig 20 of Pellerin:2002a
    + Inside the nebula, things will be very different since some of these lines could be in emission instead of absorption
      + [ ] *run Cloudy model* to see if we can get predicted spectrum in PDR
        - See what we have got from the [[file:~/Dropbox/cloudy-dust-charging/cloudy-dust-charging.org][cloudy-dust-charging]] project
    + This is mentioned in Luridiana:2009a
+ Look at variation of the raman wings, and correlations with 6634 absorption
+ Given that Dopita has narrower line than us, it might absorb more than just the Raman pseudo-continuum



*** Correlation between 6634 and Raman wings for Orion
+ Choose suitable ranges - use the 8x8 binned cube
+ Regions free of any strong lines:
  + 6410 \to 6450 \AA = 31 \to 78 pix
  + 6760 \to 6810 \AA = 442 \to 502 pix (some C II lines but super weak)
  + [ ] Maybe we could divide each continuum range in two to give 4 sections, and take median of each
    + This would be insensitive to absorption or emission lines as long as there are not too many of them
    + Then fit quadratic through the 4 points
+ Regions for Red Raman wing
  + 6600 \to 6629 \AA = 253 \to 289 pix (width 37)
  + 6638 \to 6656 \AA = 290 \to 320 pix (width 29)
  + First attempt, just sum these
  + [ ] Fit a quadratic through these
+ Region for the 6634 \AA absorption line
  + 6631 \to 6638 \AA = 290 \to 298 pix (width 9)
+ Blue Raman wing
  + Weak OH Sky lines
    + 6499
    + 6505
  + Real nebular lines
    + [N II] 6527
    + [Ni III] 6534


**** Lines found in the wavsec3 cube
+ [Ni III] 6401.5
  + HH 202 and 203 strong on blue flank
  + Maybe a Ne I 6402.25 blend, but it doesn't really look like it
+ Perhaps something like [Fe II] at 6401, but exceedingly weak
+ High ionization line at 6457 - very weak
+ [C II] 6461.95 - nice and strong
  + Shows the inner shell nicely on the red flank
+ [N II] 6527
+ [Ni III] 6533

#+RESULTS:
: None

*** The supposed Si II fluoresced bump
+ Dopita sees this at 6470 \to 6480
+ We see nothing there
+ But we do see a bulge at 6530 near the bar
*** Other H lines
+ H beta has the wings
+ Paschen line are too weak to see the wings, and too many other lines in the way


*** Other weak lines in range
+ 6401 [Ni III] + Ne I
  + Check if [Ni III] 6401/6534 tells us something
+ 6462 C II recomb
+ 6666 [Ni II]
+ Another notch at 6530, or a gap between two lines
  + There is [N II] 6527 and [Ni III] 6534
  + Those two lines are clearly seen in Dopita spectra
  + And in MUSE spectra too
+ [ ] 6544.3 seen in SPM spectra - what is it?
** Relation with foreground extinction
+ Show that the 6634 feature is not correlated with reddening
+ But the other DIB features are - maybe
*** Correlation between the different reddening measures 
*** Correlation between reddening and DIB
** Stellar absorption lines
+ The low-mass stars have absorption lines too
  + 6663 - Si III
  + 6634 - N III - shows up in a few stars
    + 219-355 - 5:35:21.8801 -5:23:54.789
    + 159-350 - 5:35:15.8718 -5:23:48.515
    + 210-349 - 5:35:21.0189 -5:23:48.808
      + Narrow line at 6635
      + Also, 6593, 6609.5, 6663.9, 6708.1
    + 181-245 - 5:35:18.0745 -5:22:45.107
    + 
  + 6496 - shows up nearly everywhere
    + Accompanied by weaker lines: 6483, 6463, 6451, 6440, 6421, 6402, etc
** Look at other Orion datasets
+ Keck proplyd spectra
  + Unfortunately, we have an inter-order gap from 6622 \to 6649 \AA, which our line falls right in the middle of
+ [X] Adal spectra
  + /Resolution in red is not as good as I thought/
    + Pixels are 0.83 \AA = 40 km/s at H\alpha, and resolution should be at best 2x this, so 80 km/s or R = 4000
    + This is very similar to MUSE, but not quite as good I don't think
  + We see it for POS 6 in Orion S - strangely not as deep as one might expect
  + POS 4 near Trapezium
  + POS 1 near Trapezium
  + POS 2 crosses Bright Bar
  + Blue spectra are all high resolution, but there are symmetrical ghosts around all the bright lines, which makes it impossible to see any possible wings on H beta for instance
+ [X] O'Dell & Harris
  + The spectral resolution is not very good - we do see the absorption, but only just
+ [X] Manuel PPAK spectra
  + Good example is [[file:~/Dropbox/RubinWFC3/Tsquared/manu-region-specplot-r-6600-6800-x-250-y-350-w0400-h0200.jpg][file:~/Dropbox/RubinWFC3/Tsquared/manu-region-specplot-r-6600-6800-x-250-y-350-w0400-h0200.jpg]]
+ [ ] STIS
  + I don't seem to have the files any more
  + Best bet would seem to be from Bally program GO8324
  + There is a 6581 \to 6867 \AA spectrum in a slit from LV2 to LV6, same as for the NUV lines
  + See [[file:~/Dropbox/STIS-LV/stis-lv.org][file:~/Dropbox/STIS-LV/stis-lv.org]]
+ Herbig's HIRES th1E spectra
  + Has same problem as other Keck data
* Absorption at 6634 \AA in other regions
** TODO RCW 49
+ Illuminated by the massive cluster Westerlund 2, supposedly second most massive in Milky Way
+ Zeidler:2018a
+ They seem to have a lot of MUSE data - including deep fields
  + Now downloading to [[file:~/Work/Muse-Hii-Data/RCW49/][file:~/Work/Muse-Hii-Data/RCW49/]]
+ We see the 6614 absorption line, but that seems to be scattered stellar
  + Or DIB - see below
+ [2019-08-06 Tue 22:10] I don't see any evidence of the Raman scattering or the 6634 line in what I have looked at so far
** 30 Doradus: Tarantula
+ I see absolutely nothing
+ Files are at
  + [[file:~/Work/Muse-Hii-Data/30Dor]]
+ [2019-08-01 Thu]  *I do see the line!!*
+ Much weaker than Orion, but it looks very similar
+ We are looking in an 8x8 arcsec box
+ A good place is centered on 84.642977 -69.10802
+ Minimum absorption is at observed wavelength of 6638.74 and 6637.49 - about halfway between them, so 6638.1 \AA
+ So is rest wavelength is 6633.9 then V = +190 km/s, whereas [N II] is at +250
  + From below, we have a DIB with 6632.85, which would give 5.25 \AA or +240, which is much better
+ Absorption depth:
  + Mean: (193.36 - 188.56)/193.36 = 0.0248
  + Median: (186.45 - 181.59)/186.45 = 0.026
  + So less than 3%, whereas in Orion S it is up to 8%
*** Other lines with different behavior
+ Si III 5740 is seen in emission and absorption (in some stars)
+ DIB 5781 is seen in absorption everywhere - need to check if depth scales with reddening
+ 
+ He II 4686 broad emission line is seen everywhere
  + Can be used to track scattered starlight from the WR stars (there are about 3 of them in the A field)
  + Some stars have absorption in this line, but that doesn't seem to be imprinted on the nebula much
  + There is an artefact at 4688 \to 4691 \AA in the top center of field A
    + At first I thought there was some narrow absorption, but it is in bizarre horizontal stripes
    + Also around 6252 \AA in same region

  + 6196
    - I see something at 6196.95 but it is supposed to be at 6195.97
    - And there is nothing at 6614, which should be stronger - so no
  + 5780
    - Broad absorption at 5781.649
    - But wavelength not right, should be at 5780.37
    - And we see nothing at 5797
  + 6284
    - Seen clearly
    - I might have got my wavelength wrong before - was using 6278 which is way off
    - Confusion with sky absorption

* Absorption line profile
+ Can we get a good handle on how broad it is
+ Make a mask that includes the best points (do this for each object)
+ Adjust the wavelengths according to the velocities maybe
  + This would give better sampling of the profile
  + But which line do we use? No guarantee that absorbing medium shares kinematics of the emitting gas, although in Carina this will probably be true
+ If width is not too small, could be DIB
  + The 6614 \AA DIB (which we don't see) has a width of 50 km/s or 1.1 \AA, which we would not well resolve (see Krelowski:2018a, pronounced KreWoVski because it is a ł)
  + In fact, Galazutdinov:2000a show a DIB at 6632.85, which might possibly be our feature
    + It isn't listed as new, so it must be in previous papers too
    + It is only seen in highly reddened stars, not in HD 23180
* Explanations for absorption
** Summary
1. Really a gap between two weak emission line forests
   - Not consistent with Orion, which shows smooth continuum
2. Stellar absorption line that is scattered
   - Late B stars have the N III 6633.9 line
   - But they also have other lines
     - E.g. O II 6641.031
3. DIB
   - I think this is the most likely
   - Need to compare with 5782 and 6278 bands
     - Those are correlated with reddening
     - But 6634 is not
   - Note that DIBs are thought to be molecular, according to Krełowski:
     #+begin_quote
     The nearly constant positions and nearly unchanged profiles of DIBs, irrespective of the line of sight, point to free gas-phase molecules as the carriers of these bands. [...]

* Antecedents for Raman scattering
** Theory
+ Hubeny & Mihalas book
+ 
*** Wavelength mapping between Ly\beta and H\alpha domain
+ Let \nu_0 be pre-scattered and \nu_1 be post-scattered frequency
  + \Delta\nu_1 = \Delta\nu_0 for Raman scattering
  + \lambda_1 = c/\nu_1 => d\lambda_1/d\nu_1 = -c / \nu_1^2 = -\lambda_1^2 / c 
  + \Delta\lambda_1 = d\lambda_1/d\nu_1 \Delta\nu_1 = -\lambda_1^2 \Delta\nu_1 / c
  + \Delta\lambda_0 = -\lambda_0^2 \Delta\nu_0 / c
  + \Delta\lambda_1 / \Delta\lambda_0 = (\lambda_1^2 / \lambda_0^2) (\Delta\nu_1 / \Delta\nu_0) = (\lambda_1 / \lambda_0)^2
+ So wavelength differences \Delta\lambda transform as \lambda^2
+ And velocity differences \Delta{}u = c \Delta\lambda / \lambda scale as \lambda
+ Velocity-scale factor between Ly\beta and H\alpha is \lambda_1 / \lambda_0 = (1 - 1/9) / (1/4 - 1/9) = 6.4
+ Wavelength-scale factor is 40.96 
*** Column densities
+ Lee:2009a say that Raman optical depth 
*** Red-blue asymmetry in wings
*** Excitation from continuum versus lines
+ O VI 1032,38 \to 6827,7088 in symbiotic stars
+ 
** Symbiotic stars
+ Lots of work
  + Schmid:1989a
    + O VI lines Raman scatter off Ly\beta to give 6830, 7088 \AA bands
    + This is much further from resonance, so requires much larger column densities than for the H\alpha wings
    + E.g, 6830 - 6563 = 267 \AA
    + Whereas, our wings go out to 6700 - 6563 = 137 \AA
    + So they have 4 times lower cross section for that
    + Also, they have flux ratio 6830/6563 of about 0.05
    + We have 3e4/1.5e9 = 2e-5
      + 3e4 is measured around 6700 \AA, d\lambda = 137 \AA
      + 2.2e5 at 6600 \AA gives Raman/Core of 1.5e-4 for d\lambda = 37 \AA
      + So we would expect 14 times higher, whereas we observe 2.2e5/3e4 = 7.3 /probably the 6700 region is contaminated with weak lines/
    + So, our prediction for 6830/6563 would be 1.5e-4 (37/267)**2 = 2.9e-6
      + This is 6e-5 times what is observed in symbiotic stars
      + So, if this were all down to column density, we would require a *1e4 times smaller column*
      + Although there will also be a dependence on F(Ly\beta) / F(H\alpha), where Ly\beta is measured in the neutral slab
