* Absorption at 6634 \AA in Orion Nebula
+ [[https://www.evernote.com/l/ACSenDsvfD1AsZwl6SJxcieZcyrDhIYlOVw][Public link to Evernote note]]

** Relation to Raman-scattered wings of H\alpha
+ See Dopita:2016a
  + These are pumped by continuum or O I 1025.76, which is very close to Ly \beta 1025.72
    + Wavelength in H\alpha frame: 6562.79 + (1025.76 - 1025.72) 40.96 = 6564.4284
    + Redshifted by 3e5 (6564.4284 - 6562.79)/6562.79 = 75 km/s
  + Also, secondary component pumped by Si II 1023.70, which gives a peak at 6480.1
    + Test my understanding of scale factor
    + (1023.70 - 1025.72) 40.96 = -82.7392
    + 6562.79 - 82.7392 = 6480.05 QED
+ *This gives another possibility for the 6634 origin*
  + Could be a stellar absorption line just redward of Ly \beta
  + Raman scattering causes wavelength differences \Delta\lambda/\lambda from Ly \beta center (1025.72 \AA) to be mapped to differences 6.4 \Delta\lambda/\lambda from H\alpha line center
    - This is (1 - 1/9) / (1/4 - 1/9) = 6.4
    - This is factor for velocity shifts (\propto \Delta\lambda/\lambda), so for \Delta\lambda itself, the factor is squared: 40.96
    - So 6634 - 6563 = 70 \AA, so 70/40.96 = 1.709 \AA at Ly \beta => 1027.43 \AA (vacuum)
    - *I have solved the mystery!!!*
      - It is the 1027.43051 and 1027.43125 components of the O I resonance line
        - These are transitions from the J=1 level, which is 0.019622 eV above the ground (J=2) level, but it should be populated according to statistical weight so long as T > 0.019622 eV/k = 228 K
        - There is also a 1028.15710 component from the J=0 level, which should give a line at 6562.79 + (1028.15710 - 1025.72) 40.96 = 6662.613616
        - /Which is what I thought was Si III 6662.90 !!!/
        - All lines of multiplet

      - What is the observed width of the O I lines, and what do they correspond to in the FUV domain?
        - FWHM is about 4.5 pix or 3.8 \AA, as opposed to 3 pix = 2.5 \AA for the emission lines
          - FWZI is 9.5 as opposed to 6 pixels
        - This is 174 km/s as opposed to 114 km/s, so this gives a instrument-corrected width of 130 km/s \to 20 km/s in FUV
        - This is very broad and can't be thermal or even non-thermal kinematic
        - Must be due to line-center \tau \gg 1, so could use a curve of growth on the EW
        - Also, this means that residual emission at line center is giving us the line-center source function!
  + Possible lines in blue wing:
    + /I don't actually believe any of these/
      + More plausible that they are gaps between emission lines
    + 6494.75 \to 1025.72 + (6494.75 - 6562.79)/40.96 = 1024.06
      + There is S I at 1023.91, which should give 6562.79 + (1023.91 - 1025.72) 40.96 = 6488.65
        + But that is not close enough
      + Si II at 1020.6989 and 1023.7001
        + 6357.13, 6480.05
        + The 6480.05 line /might/ be detected, but the absorption looks to be centered on 6481.15, which would be 0.01 \AA redder in FUV, whereas claimed wavelength accuracy is 0.0007 \AA
      + Fe II] intercombination line at 1024.14514 (no A-value given) \to 6498.3 \AA
        + Does correspond to a weak but consistent dip
        + Although we can't rule out weak optical emission lines
    + If the dips are just gaps between emission lines, then the lines are
      + 6521.1 weak/broad
      + 6516 very weak
      + 6510.9 mainly ionized (maybe O II)
      + 6505.8 also mainly ionized
      + 6501.55 (maybe O II)
      + 6498.15 SKY definitely
      + 6470.1 SKY
      + 6465 SKY - not to be confused with strong 6462 C II
  + One more in the red wing
    + 6708.5 \to 1025.72 + (6708.5 - 6562.79)/40.96 = 1029.28 \AA
    + Strong in Orion S on side near Trapezium
    + Weak in Bar region
    + Could be Cl I 1029.34325
    + But this should also give 1028.17391 \to 6663.3 \AA, which is almost on top of the red component of the O I multiplet so would be hidden
    + Variation with position might be due to Cl II being dominant in Bar (density effect on Cl^+/Cl^0 ratio)
  + The near wings - are they real?
    + I am not sure
    + There is a flat bit in the spectrum from 6569 \to 6574
      + \Delta\lambda = +6 \to +11 \AA or V = +275 \to +500 km/s
    + And again from 6554 \to 6557
      + \Delta\lambda = -9 \to -6 or V = -275 \to -410 km/s
    + There seems to be a slight change with position, at the Bar at least
      + Smaller \Delta\lambda comes from more ionized regions
      + This is what we expect because the larger cross section closer to line center implies \tau = 1 comes from a smaller column
      + \Delta\lambda = 10 \AA @ H\alpha means 
  + There is O VI doublet at 1037.62, 1031.93 but this is a very strong P Cygni profile that absorbs everything up to and past the Ly \beta line
    + See Fig 23 of Leitherer:2010a, which shows population synthesis spectra
    + There is a lot of H_2 (and C II, O I) absorption between 1035 \to 1040, which makes this hard to see on the observed FUSE spectra, see Fig 20 of Pellerin:2002a
    + Inside the nebula, things will be very different since some of these lines could be in emission instead of absorption
      + [ ] *run Cloudy model* to see if we can get predicted spectrum in PDR
        - See what we have got from the [[file:~/Dropbox/cloudy-dust-charging/cloudy-dust-charging.org][cloudy-dust-charging]] project
    + This is mentioned in Luridiana:2009a
    + But note that the difference between O VI and Ly\beta is 1031.93 - 1025.72 = 6.21 \AA, which corresponds to 1800 km/s, whereas velocity of thC wind is only 1200 km/s
      + So it doesn't get all the way to H\beta - the blue edge will be at 1031.93 (1 - 1200/3e5) = 1027.8 \AA
      + In the H\alpha domain this is 6562.79 + (1027.8 - 1025.72) 40.96 = 6648 \AA
+ Look at variation of the raman wings, and correlations with 6634 absorption
+ Given that Dopita has narrower line than us, it might absorb more than just the Raman pseudo-continuum

**** Conclusions based on Cloudy model spectra
+ The ~dustrad~ models all stop at 4000 K, so just on neutral side of i-front
+ There are a variety of column densities, depending on the ionization parameter (proportional to (Q n)^{1/3})
+ Lines are not properly resolved in the output - look like triangles
+ Ly\alpha is seen in emission in the ~total~ spectrum, which is transmitted plus reflected
+ Ly\beta is in absorption in all spectra
  + Absorption depth seems slightly less in transmitted and total spectra
  + 1025.72 \AA = 0.889 Ryd
  + The reddest O I component is at 1028.16 = 0.887 Ryd
  + The Cloudy continuum mesh points are at [..., 0.8850, 0.8880, 0.8909, ...]
    + [..., 1024, 1027, 1030, ...] in \AA
  + This corresponds to resolving power R = 1025/(2 3) = 171 so clearly insufficient to see details in spectrum
  + We need to use the ~Save fine continuum [range, merge]~ command to see it better
    + Fine continuum has R = 1.737e+05, or 1.7 km/s, which would be 10.9 km/s at H\alpha, which is plenty fine enough
+ Continuum across Ly\beta rises to red, but only 10% in 50\AA
+ Stellar emission line at about 1045 \AA = 0.87 Ryd
+ Important caveat from Hazy
  : In general the treatment of scattering is very geometry dependent. The output produced by the save continuum commands does not include the pumped part of the line contribution. This is correct if the continuum source is included in the beam, but is not if only the gas is observed.
  + This is because absorption and emission cancel out when integrated over the line profile
  + So I think it is OK in our case, since the spectrum as seen by the neutral gas /does/ include the transmitted stellar continuum
+ 


**** TODO [#A] Run more cloudy models
+ Save fine continuum (see above)
+ Stop at various depths
+ Dig out atmosphere models for Trapezium
**** Further spectra for different models

*** Correlation between 6634 and Raman wings for Orion
+ Choose suitable ranges - use the 8x8 binned cube
+ Regions free of any strong lines:
  + 6410 \to 6450 \AA = 31 \to 78 pix
  + 6760 \to 6810 \AA = 442 \to 502 pix (some C II lines but super weak)
  + [ ] Maybe we could divide each continuum range in two to give 4 sections, and take median of each
    + This would be insensitive to absorption or emission lines as long as there are not too many of them
    + Then fit quadratic through the 4 points
+ Regions for Red Raman wing
  + 6600 \to 6629 \AA = 253 \to 289 pix (width 37)
  + 6638 \to 6656 \AA = 290 \to 320 pix (width 29)

  + [ ] Fit a quadratic through these
+ Region for the 6634 \AA absorption line
  + 6631 \to 6638 \AA = 290 \to 298 pix (width 9)

  + Weak OH Sky lines
    + 6499
    + 6505
  + Real nebular lines
    + [N II] 6527
    + [Ni III] 6534


**** Lines found in the wavsec3 cube
+ [Ni III] 6401.5
  + HH 202 and 203 strong on blue flank
  + Maybe a Ne I 6402.25 blend, but it doesn't really look like it
+ Perhaps something like [Fe II] at 6401, but exceedingly weak
+ High ionization line at 6457 - very weak
+ [C II] 6461.95 - nice and strong

** Look at other Orion datasets
+ Keck proplyd spectra
  + Unfortunately, we have an inter-order gap from 6622 \to 6649 \AA, which our line falls right in the middle of
+ [X] Adal spectra
  + /Resolution in red is not as good as I thought/
    + Pixels are 0.83 \AA = 40 km/s at H\alpha, and resolution should be at best 2x this, so 80 km/s or R = 4000
    + This is very similar to MUSE, but not quite as good I don't think
  + We see it for POS 6 in Orion S - strangely not as deep as one might expect
  + POS 4 near Trapezium
  + POS 1 near Trapezium
  + POS 2 crosses Bright Bar
  + Blue spectra are all high resolution, but there are symmetrical ghosts around all the bright lines, which makes it impossible to see any possible wings on H beta for instance
+ [X] O'Dell & Harris
  + The spectral resolution is not very good - we do see the absorption, but only just
+ [X] Manuel PPAK spectra
  + Good example is [[file:~/Dropbox/RubinWFC3/Tsquared/manu-region-specplot-r-6600-6800-x-250-y-350-w0400-h0200.jpg][file:~/Dropbox/RubinWFC3/Tsquared/manu-region-specplot-r-6600-6800-x-250-y-350-w0400-h0200.jpg]]

+ They seem to have a lot of MUSE data - including deep fields
  + Now downloading to [[file:~/Work/Muse-Hii-Data/RCW49/][file:~/Work/Muse-Hii-Data/RCW49/]]
+ We see the 6614 absorption line, but that seems to be scattered stellar
  + Or DIB - see below
+ [2019-08-06 Tue 22:10] I don't see any evidence of the Raman scattering or the 6634 line in what I have looked at so far
** 30 Doradus: Tarantula
+ I see absolutely nothing
+ Files are at
  + [[file:~/Work/Muse-Hii-Data/30Dor]]
+ [2019-08-01 Thu]  *I do see the line!!*
+ Much weaker than Orion, but it looks very similar
+ We are looking in an 8x8 arcsec box
+ A good place is centered on 84.642977 -69.10802
+ Minimum absorption is at observed wavelength of 6638.74 and 6637.49 - about halfway between them, so 6638.1 \AA
+ So is rest wavelength is 6633.9 then V = +190 km/s, whereas [N II] is at +250
  + From below, we have a DIB with 6632.85, which would give 5.25 \AA or +240, which is much better
+ Absorption depth:
  + Mean: (193.36 - 188.56)/193.36 = 0.0248
  + Median: (186.45 - 181.59)/186.45 = 0.026
  + So less than 3%, whereas in Orion S it is up to 8%
*** Other lines with different behavior
+ Si III 5740 is seen in emission and absorption (in some stars)
+ DIB 5781 is seen in absorption everywhere - need to check if depth scales with reddening
+ 
+ He II 4686 broad emission line is seen everywhere
  + Can be used to track scattered starlight from the WR stars (there are about 3 of them in the A field)
  + Some stars have absorption in this line, but that doesn't seem to be imprinted on the nebula much
  + There is an artefact at 4688 \to 4691 \AA in the top center of field A
    + At first I thought there was some narrow absorption, but it is in bizarre horizontal stripes
    + Also around 6252 \AA in same region

  + 6196
    - I see something at 6196.95 but it is supposed to be at 6195.97
    - And there is nothing at 6614, which should be stronger - so no
  + 5780
    - Broad absorption at 5781.649
    - But wavelength not right, should be at 5780.37
    - And we see nothing at 5797
  + 6284
    - Seen clearly
    - I might have got my wavelength wrong before - was using 6278 which is way off
    - Confusion with sky absorption

* Absorption line profile
+ Can we get a good handle on how broad it is
+ Make a mask that includes the best points (do this for each object)
+ Adjust the wavelengths according to the velocities maybe
  + This would give better sampling of the profile
  + But which line do we use? No guarantee that absorbing medium shares kinematics of the emitting gas, although in Carina this will probably be true
+ If width is not too small, could be DIB
  + The 6614 \AA DIB (which we don't see) has a width of 50 km/s or 1.1 \AA, which we would not well resolve (see Krelowski:2018a, pronounced KreWoVski because it is a ł)
  + In fact, Galazutdinov:2000a show a DIB at 6632.85, which might possibly be our feature
    + It isn't listed as new, so it must be in previous papers too
    + It is only seen in highly reddened stars, not in HD 23180
* Explanations for absorption
** Summary
1. Really a gap between two weak emission line forests
   - Not consistent with Orion, which shows smooth continuum
2. Stellar absorption line that is scattered
   - Late B stars have the N III 6633.9 line
   - But they also have other lines
     - E.g. O II 6641.031
3. DIB
   - I think this is the most likely
   - Need to compare with 5782 and 6278 bands
     - Those are correlated with reddening
     - But 6634 is not
   - Note that DIBs are thought to be molecular, according to Krełowski:
     #+begin_quote
     The nearly constant positions and nearly unchanged profiles of DIBs, irrespective of the line of sight, point to free gas-phase molecules as the carriers of these bands. [...]

*** Wavelength mapping between Ly\beta and H\alpha domain
+ Let \nu_0 be pre-scattered and \nu_1 be post-scattered frequency
  + \Delta\nu_1 = \Delta\nu_0 for Raman scattering
  + \lambda_1 = c/\nu_1 => d\lambda_1/d\nu_1 = -c / \nu_1^2 = -\lambda_1^2 / c 
  + \Delta\lambda_1 = d\lambda_1/d\nu_1 \Delta\nu_1 = -\lambda_1^2 \Delta\nu_1 / c
  + \Delta\lambda_0 = -\lambda_0^2 \Delta\nu_0 / c
  + \Delta\lambda_1 / \Delta\lambda_0 = (\lambda_1^2 / \lambda_0^2) (\Delta\nu_1 / \Delta\nu_0) = (\lambda_1 / \lambda_0)^2
+ So wavelength differences \Delta\lambda transform as \lambda^2
+ And velocity differences \Delta{}u = c \Delta\lambda / \lambda scale as \lambda
+ Velocity-scale factor between Ly\beta and H\alpha is \lambda_1 / \lambda_0 = (1 - 1/9) / (1/4 - 1/9) = 6.4
+ Wavelength-scale factor is 40.96

** Symbiotic stars
+ Lots of work
  + Schmid:1989a
    + O VI lines Raman scatter off Ly\beta to give 6830, 7088 \AA bands
    + This is much further from resonance, so requires much larger column densities than for the H\alpha wings
    + E.g, 6830 - 6563 = 267 \AA
    + Whereas, our wings go out to 6700 - 6563 = 137 \AA
    + So they have 4 times lower cross section for that
    + Also, they have flux ratio 6830/6563 of about 0.05
    + We have 3e4/1.5e9 = 2e-5
      + 3e4 is measured around 6700 \AA, d\lambda = 137 \AA
      + 2.2e5 at 6600 \AA gives Raman/Core of 1.5e-4 for d\lambda = 37 \AA
      + So we would expect 14 times higher, whereas we observe 2.2e5/3e4 = 7.3 /probably the 6700 region is contaminated with weak lines/
    + So, our prediction for 6830/6563 would be 1.5e-4 (37/267)**2 = 2.9e-6
      + This is 6e-5 times what is observed in symbiotic stars
      + So, if this were all down to column density, we would require a *1e4 times smaller column*
      + Although there will also be a dependence on F(Ly\beta) / F(H\alpha), where Ly\beta is measured in the neutral slab
