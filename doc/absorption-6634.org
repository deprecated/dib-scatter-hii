* Absorption at 6634 \AA in other regions
** 30 Doradus
+ I see absolutely nothing
+ Files are at
  + [[file:~/Work/Muse-Hii-Data/30Dor]]
** Carina
+ The cube I got was in a stupid place - need to get a better one
+ [2019-08-01 Thu] No it wasn't - *I see the line!!*
+ Much weaker than Orion, but it looks very similar
+ We are looking in an 8x8 arcsec box
+ A good place is centered on 84.642977 -69.10802
+ Minimum absorption is at observed wavelength of 6638.74 and 6637.49 - about halfway between them, so 6638.1 \AA
+ So is rest wavelength is 6633.9 then V = +190 km/s, whereas [N II] is at +250
  + From below, we have a DIB with 6632.85, which would give 5.25 \AA or +240, which is much better
+ On the other hand, if we are seeing the same line in sky emission, then it is 6633.74, but the line still doesn't seem red enough
+ Absorption depth:
  + Mean: (193.36 - 188.56)/193.36 = 0.0248
  + Median: (186.45 - 181.59)/186.45 = 0.026
  + So less than 3%, whereas in Orion S it is up to 8%
** Other lines with different behavior
+ Si III 5740 is seen in emission and absorption (in some stars)
+ DIB 5781 is seen in absorption everywhere - constant absorption depth I think
+ He II 4686 broad emission line is seen everywhere
  + Can be used to track scattered starlight from the WR stars (there are about 3 of them in the A field)
  + Some stars have absorption in this line, but that doesn't seem to be imprinted on the nebula much
  + There is an artefact at 4688 \to 4691 \AA in the top center of field A
    + At first I thought there was some narrow absorption, but it is in bizarre horizontal stripes

#+RESULTS:

* Absorption line profile
+ Can we get a good handle on how broad it is
+ Make a mask that includes the best points (do this for each object)
+ Adjust the wavelengths according to the velocities maybe
  + This would give better sampling of the profile
  + But which line do we use? No guarantee that absorbing medium shares kinematics of the emitting gas, although in Carina this will probably be true
+ If width is not too small, could be DIB
  + The 6614 \AA DIB (which we don't see) has a width of 50 km/s or 1.1 \AA, which we would not well resolve (see Krelowski:2018a, pronounced KreWoVski because it is a Å‚)
  + In fact, Galazutdinov:2000a show a DIB at 6632.85, which might possibly be our feature
    + It isn't listed as new, so it must be in previous papers too
    + It is only seen in highly reddened stars, not in HD 23180
* Explanations for absorption
** Summary
1. Really a gap between two weak emission line forests
   - Not consistent with Orion, which shows smooth continuum
2. Stellar absorption line that is scattered
   - Late B stars have the N III 6633.9 line
   - But they also have other lines
     - E.g. O II 6641.031
3. DIB
   - I think this is the most likely
   - Need to compare with 5782 and 6278 bands
